Exotic World had been started in an attempt to create a space where the history of the burlesque arts would be remembered and where aging performers could find a home. The extensive collection contained everything from old costumes and intricate pasties to fliers for shows and playbills shouting such famous burlesque names as Chesty Morgan and Candy Barr.    Evans operated Exotic World in its original California home for a number of years before she moved the entire operation to the spiritual home of burlesque, Las Vegas. In this new location, the collection was renamed the Burlesque Hall of Fame and moved into a location on historic Fremont Street where it continues to thrive. Today the collection has grown to contain several thousand costumes, stage props, photographs, and personal effects documenting the careers and lives of burlesque dancers, comics, and producers across nearly a century of performances. The Burlesque Hall of Fame is a growing testament to the power and social impact of the art of the tease.	This institution collects the history of burlesque dancing with a titillating collection of ephemera and pasties.
