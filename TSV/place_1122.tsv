0	Trolltunga	cliffs,geological oddities,natural wonders,geology,nature	123	1304	Trolltunga is a spectacular example of the geological oddities that dot the Norwegian landscape.The fittingly named “Troll’s Tongue” sticks out of a vertical mountainside above a 700 meter (about 2,300 feet) drop. The scenic cliff offers a magnificent view of lake Ringedalsvatnet in Skjeggedal. It was made thousands of years ago by water from a glacier freezing off part of the rock. Keep an eye on your feet as there’s no safety rail here. You can take a funicular up part of the way, though it isn’t always functioning. Otherwise, it is roughly an 8 to 10-hour hike roundtrip through mountains and waterfalls to the ledge.In recent years, this spot has become more popular with travelers looking for that perfect Instagram shot. If waiting in line to take a photo isn’t to your liking, this might no longer be a good destination for you. 	"Walk 2,300 feet above the ground on the ""Troll's Tongue."""
