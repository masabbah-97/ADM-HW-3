Water is then forced in from the bottom of the cup creating an evenly distributed, incredibly thin layer of water. The ball, no matter how heavy, can then be moved on the liquid surface as though it weighed nothing at all.A number of these floating stone spheres can be found around the globe; however the Grand Kugel, installed in 2003, is the largest of these sculptural science experiments in the world. Originally shaped out of South African granite, the ball is almost nine feet in diameter and weighs in at 29 tons. The first stone, which was placed in the pedestal outside of the Science Museum of Virginia, developed a crack that eventually made the shape not perfectly spherical, which in turn caused the massive stone to simply sit in its cradle immovable as the boulder it was. While this unfortunate flaw forced the museum to replace the huge stone, it also perfectly showed how even a slight disruption in the layer of water can disrupt the effect.The Grand Kugel’s ball has since been replaced, and the miraculous effect restored.Nearby, 250 feet away, is a smaller kugel representing the Moon, at the same scale, and at a distance to scale. Together they form the Mary Morton Parsons Earth-Moon Sculpture.At this scale (4.8 million:1), the Sun would be 19.37 miles away.	This 29-ton granite ball spins around at the slightest touch thanks to a scientific phenomenon.
