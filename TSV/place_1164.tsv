The title is derived from the Latin word “lucere,” meaning “to shine,” and the artwork’s 3,115 lights depict a scale map of the stars that shine in the night sky.The 13-foot artwork contains thousands of glass bulbs, all fed light through blue illuminating fiber-optic lines. The sculpture, created by English artist Wolfgang Buttress with the help of astrophysicist Dr. Daniel Bayliss, represents a 3D map of all the stars in the Northern Hemisphere that are able visible with the naked eye.All of the piece’s glass bulbs were hand blown by artists at a local glass studio. Each one of the more than 3,000 bulbs is amplified even more against a mirrored ceiling above and a reflecting pool below. The end result is a piece that seems to go on forever, light looping from sky to ground over and over again.The cosmic-inspired sculpture, Buttress told Chicago Magazine, aims to expresses “the idea of looking up and sensing wonder.”	A shining sculpture made of 3,115 lights, the number of visible stars in the Northern Hemisphere.
