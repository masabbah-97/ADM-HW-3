The collection is said to include more than 3,500 objects of historical significance, including previously classified documents, specialized weaponry, unique uniforms, and even a purpose-built semi-submersible. Much of the collection was donated by current and former members of the CIA, as well as its previous incarnation as the Office of Special Services. According to the CIA, many of the objects the museum holds were designed, manufactured, and used specifically for intelligence operations.Since the museum is located inside the CIA’s heavily guarded compound, it’s not possible to visit, but they often work with presidential libraries and other major museums to arrange public exhibitions elsewhere.	A secretive collection featuring objects that were designed specifically for U.S. intelligence operations.
