This shop carries an immense variety of soda brands from all corners of the U.S., and as far away as Romania. Its catalog includes obscure, almost forgotten, old brands and imports available in only a few spots on the planet.

He can authoritatively explain why glass bottles are better than plastic ones and why Kosher for Passover Coca-Cola are superior to the normal variety. He stands always ready to suggest a new variety or flavor.Galco’s Soda Pop Stop offers online purchases with limited international delivery. 	Shop selling 500 flavors of soda has something for everyone.
