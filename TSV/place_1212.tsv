The wreckage is still visible, making it a popular tourist attraction as one of the most accessible shipwrecks of the Graveyard of the Pacific. No one was able to remove the boat, so it just stayed there. Over the last 101 years it has slowly deteriorated.One can still see a very large piece of the ship and during low tide one can walk right up to it.	100-year-old shipwreck you can walk up to at low tide.
