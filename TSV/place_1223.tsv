Between 1992 and 2006, the late Brown used warped shingles and oddly wrapping staircases to give his one bedroom home on the corner of Erie and Tarpis Ave. a look like no other.The shingles covering the sides of the home are meant to resemble the delicate sheets on the underside of a mushroom, while the bulbous decorative roofing complete the fungal look. We also added a glass-walled sun room protruding from one end of the building which certainly makes it look a bit less organic, but nonetheless magical.Unfortunately Brown passed away in 2008, but the Mushroom House remains a beloved landmark in the neighborhood, and doesn’t look to be wilting any time soon. Maybe the new owners can let the world know why the appeal to live in a mushroom is so damn strong.   	What is it about mushrooms that makes people wish they lived inside of them?
