Plucked straight from a storybook, the trail is filled with old trees—a mixture of temperate bigleaf maples and Sitka spruces—draped in green and brown mosses.The Hoh Rain Forest is named for the ever-flowing Hoh River that carves its way from Mount Olympus towards the Pacific Coast.  In the winter, the forest receives most of its yearly average of 140 inches (3.55 meters) of precipitation. All that water results in a lush, green canopy above and a blanket of mosses and ferns blanket below.Along the main trail, there is an otherworldly 200-foot side path that leads to an enchanting grove of giant maple trees cloaked in hanging moss. One visitor to the trail wrote that “the trees stand like green-robed figures of eld.”	Stroll through a wonderland of stupendous moss-covered trees.
