But surprisingly, this strange “bridge to nowhere” actually does lead to somewhere.  It’s used by those looking to cross the Biel Water, a reasonably large stream that runs through the village of Biel just to the south of Dunbar, Scotland. The stream runs for almost three miles from the Luggate Burn before eventually finding its way into to Belhaven Bay.Just before it discharges into the North Sea, the stream flows under a short metal footbridge with concrete pillars and steps. At low tide, you can walk over this bridge to access the beach beyond it.When the tide comes surging into the shore, what should be an easy path to the beach becomes suddenly impassable. At high tide, the water swallows the land around the bridge, making it look as though it’s stranded in the middle of a sea. Though not helpful for those looking to cross, the sight of the lonely bridge surrounded by swirling waters that reflect the colors of the sky above makes for a beautiful photograph.	At high tide this strange footbridge appears to have no purpose whatsoever.
