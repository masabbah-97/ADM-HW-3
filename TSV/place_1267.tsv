While some buildings have been flattened, over 35 of them remain standing and in various states of disrepair. Entry to all buildings is prohibited, and security officers are regularly present to enforce this rule, but visitors are welcome to explore the abandoned grounds and many walking paths, free of cost.Since closing, the hospital also served as filming locations for motion pictures such as Shutter Island, The Box, and Knives Out. The Town of Medfield officially purchased the hospital in December 2014, and the future of this magnificent historical site is uncertain. For now, what better place to have a picnic than at the open grounds of an abandoned asylum?	Unlike other abandoned asylums this empty institution welcomes visitors, just don't go in the buildings.
