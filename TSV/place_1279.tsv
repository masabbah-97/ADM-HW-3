Is your soul dirty and filled with bad energy?For just about anything that ails you, there’s a solution in the Sonora Market, the largest esoteric market in Mexico and a must-see for those interested in mysticism. Local vendors have an answer to any of life’s daily troubles in the form of a magic soap, a holy water spray, or a love potion that uses toloache, a plant with hallucinogenic properties. The span of products offered is immense, ranging from fruits and vegetables to bread or shampoo or caged animals from chickens to dogs and rabbits. You can buy just about anything. A large array of vernacular religions are represented in Sonora, from Voodoo to la Santa Muerte via Brujeria, the Mexican term for sorcery which comes with its own bizarre recipe. A number of these beliefs are practiced by people alongside their Catholic faith, a syncretic phenomenon with the most incredible imagery and rituals. 	Superstitious?
