In its heyday, it had over 50 full-time employees and a regular rotation of children invited to play.While other millionaires have expressed interest in purchasing it, and there have been proposals to turn it into a memorial museum, so far no deals have come through.  	The abandoned personal amusement park of the King of Pop.
