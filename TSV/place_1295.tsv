These murals collectively express a love letter from a guy to a girl, from an artist to his hometown, and from local residents to their neighborhood of West Philadelphia. A tour is regularly conducted, mostly on board the train, alighting on the platform only a couple of times. Most of the murals were only seen as brief colorful flashes on walls of decrepit buildings.	One artist's love letter to his city and its citizens plays out across dozens of bright murals painted on the sides of decrepit buildings.
