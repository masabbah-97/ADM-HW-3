From the street, it’s virtually nonexistent (at  least during the summer months).Glass isn’t the material that usually comes to mind when you picture a treehouse, but it’s quite a magical combo. (See for yourself on this YouTube video tour of the house.) The elevated, see-through dwelling is surrounded by greenery. Light dances off of its simple surfaces.The two-floor house is made of mostly recycled materials, mainly glass panels between steel hardware. It was pieced together by the house’s owner, a designer and builder, as funds allowed. Now finished, both levels of this unique abode can be rented on Airbnb, if you’re lucky enough to find an open night. 	Suspended above the ground in a thicket of towering Georgia trees is a modern architectural wonder.
