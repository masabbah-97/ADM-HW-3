The museum-cum-restaurant features the largest collection of pizza memorabilia in the world.From sword-wielding Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figurines wearing Pizza Hut sweaters to a slice-shaped remote control to a wall lined with pie-themed album covers, no surface is free from pizza pizazz. In addition to one founder’s enormous collection, the museum continues to receive pizza memorabilia from near and far. Located in Fishtown, a Philadelphia neighborhood that has become a haven for creatives and young professionals, the museum is also a pizza parlor. Menu options range from the simple (the “Jane” comes with mozzarella, aged provolone, grana padano, and fresh basil) to the decadent (the “Kira Tierston” comes with mozzarella, smoked bacon, a bit of brown sugar, red onion, and oven-roasted brussels sprouts). Diners with a sweet tooth can chase their pie with a scoop from the adjacent ice cream shop, Little Baby’s, whose flavors run the gamut from Irish Potato to Chocolate Churro. The truly adventurous are can concoct what is called a Frankford Avenue Taco by topping their cheese slice with Little Baby’s pizza-flavored ice cream.	Enjoy a slice while browsing the world's largest collection of pizza memorabilia.
