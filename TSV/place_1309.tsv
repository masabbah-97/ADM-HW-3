When the keyboard is played, the entire subterranean landscape becomes a musical instrument.In order to achieve a precise musical scale, the chosen stalactites of the organ range over 3.5 acres, but due to the enclosed nature of the space, the full sound can be heard anywhere within the cavern. The organ was invented and built in 1954 by Leland Sprinkle, a mathematician and electronic scientist. It took him over three years to complete it.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Great Stalacpipe Organ. 	"An organ located deep within a cave, whose ""pipes"" are the geological features of the cave itself."
