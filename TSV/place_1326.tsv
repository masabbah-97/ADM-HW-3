The steep climb along old cable car tracks is one of the most popular “tough” workouts in the area. Depending on your fitness level it can take between 40 minutes to 2 hours to get to the top, or longer. You can climb up on foot; no climbing equipment is necessary. However, spikes are recommended in the Winter months, especially for the descent. There is a false summit located 2/3 of the way up and the trail is visible from all around Colorado Springs. The Incline connects with Barr Trail at the summit, which will continue 10 miles to the 14,000-foot summit of Pikes Peak, or back down to Manitou Springs. Descending on Barr Trail is highly recommended as going back down the Incline is dangerous. 	This super steep hike ascends 2,000 feet in less than a mile.
