While that one is 17,000 square feet, this one is a staggering 30,000 square feet. Costing around $25 million to build, the Titanic Museum Attraction also includes recreations of rooms based on actual Titanic blue prints, such as a first-class dining room and the grand staircase. Outside, an iceberg is just hitting the ship, and inside visitors can even touch a story-tall iceberg wall. All visitors receive a boarding pass that indicates they are one of the real ship passengers (you can find out your fate at the end of the visit), and all staff members are garbed as crew members and maids.The interactive exhibitions include ice water you can touch at the exact temperature that the unfortunate souls were plunged into in 1912, and there are around 400 artifacts. These include Madeline Astor’s life jacket and a tooth removed by second-class passenger Selena Cook just after the accident (she’d suffered from a toothache onboard). 	A recreation of the doomed ocean liner in the middle of the Smoky Mountains.
