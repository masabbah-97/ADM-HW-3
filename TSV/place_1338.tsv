0	Solomon's Castle	eccentric homes,homes	295	1205	"Standing in a central Florida swamp, shining in the sun, is a hand-built medieval castle complete with a moat.The sculptor Howard Solomon started building the castle in 1974 out of aluminum printing plates thrown out by the local newspaper. Years later, the ever-evolving, gleaming three-story-high castle covers 12,000 sq. feet, including the courtyard filled with sculptures made from discarded automotive parts and a 60-foot replica of a 16th century Portuguese galleon that serves as the Moat restaurant. While the structure itself captures the imagination of the child at heart, it is the pun-filled tour led by Solomon himself that is truly worth the time. Solomon is currently trying to sell the castle with a listing price of $2.5 million.
