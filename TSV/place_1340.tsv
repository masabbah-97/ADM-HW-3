It is a sculpture garden, park, and a Historic National Landmark that covers 78 acres.Many Philadelphians, short on space to grow plants, will enroll in a program to take care of a dead individual’s plot, using historically accurate plants that were commonly used in the Victorian era.Tens of thousands of graves hold statesmen, civil war veterans (both union and confederate), local celebrities, and even the fictional grave of Rocky Balboa’s wife, Adrian Balboa. A comprehensive audio tour is available via your mobile phone.	This Philly cemetery is the eternal home of many famous area residents, including Rocky Balboa's wife.
