During the summer, the oak provides a reprieve from the sultry Louisiana heat and enchanting tunes from the wind chimes strung from the branches.The chimes are all tuned to ring out in the pentatonic scale and are painted black to blend in with the plantâ€™s natural shadows. The instruments range in size, with one of them reaching a length of 14 feet. The harmonious effect is that of a relaxing, tinkling symphony.Although the Singing Oak is in plain sight of visitors, not many people know about this hidden New Orleans gem. Take a few minutes to sit beneath the Chime Tree and walk away just a little bit more relaxed than when you arrived.	This New Orleans tree is filled with hidden chimes that produce a carefully tuned melody.
