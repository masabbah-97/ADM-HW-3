0	Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies	shops,food	388	1181	Pastry aficionados are painfully aware of the difficulty of finding authentic freshly-made goodness in New York’s jungle of ready-made industrial baked goods. Steve Tarpin’s “Steve’s Authentic Key Lime Pies” has made the search a hell of a lot easier. Disillusioned with the pre-made pie crusts and bottled lime juice of mass-produced desserts, Tarpin set out to recreate the Official State Pie of his Florida birthplace. The pie follows an uncompromising five-ingredient recipe, including a specially made graham crumb formula, butter and fresh-squeezed key limes. A sense of welcome pervades the bakery and guides the pastry lieutenants. “Steve’s” started off making just three pies a week for a steakhouse in the Meat Packing District. The business operated out of a small studio and delivered pies in an aged Ford pick-up packed with coolers. However, he soon found himself tight on kitchen space as demand for his confections grew. The bakery soon changed venues to historic Red Hook and Tarpin acquired the iconic Key Lime Ford F-100 Panel Delivery Truck which he still uses. “Steve’s” spectacular transformation to one of the premier pie establishments in New York has only reinforced the bakery’s dedication to Key Lime dessert integrity.
