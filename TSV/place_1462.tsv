Skeptics would point to self-perpetuating mythologies and commercially attractive UFO-themed opportunities as the reason behind this.Believers, of course, would argue that this UFO unusualness is because the Southwest is a hub of galactic activity; a cosmic LAX, with area 51 and Roswell as the proof. Judy Messoline is one such true believer of the area’s extraterrestrial appeal.The owner of a plot of land that was already used by UFO spotters, Messoline decided to make it official. She set up an observation tower, campground, and gift shop and embraced the extraterrestrial enthusiasts and UFOlogists.Should you allow her to film you telling your story of an experience with a UFO sighting (and it seems like everyone in the region has one), she’ll give you a free UFO-themed frisbee. By all accounts an incredibly nice and accommodating host, Messoline is also an artist, and will point you to the many self-built sights at the UFO watchtower. These attractions include a rock garden and healing garden and not one, but two “energy vortexes.” Here, visitors can deposit offerings, which include everything from old hubcaps to half packets of chewing gum to plastic dinosaurs.Other notable items include two large sculptures of aliens that guard the entrance, a dome-shaped gift shop and a “magic bush,” though it is somewhat unclear what sort of “magic” inhabits this particular flora. Messoline is a notary and can also officiate at UFO-themed weddings, should the mood strike you.Perhaps the most impressive sight of them all, however, is the beautiful desert landscape, with its vast and unbelievably beautiful night skies, UFOs or not.
