Like many oversized items littering the world’s highways, the pistachio is there mainly to lure motorists into the McGinn’s Pistachio Tree Ranch and Winery Gift Shop.Unsurprisingly, there are a number of exotic, pistachio-based products for sale like chili-chocolate pistachio brittle and homemade pistachio milkshakes– although nothing is as priceless as taking a “nutty” photo under the giant snack.   	This is one really big nut.
