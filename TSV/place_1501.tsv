The botanical garden is complete with trails, bridges, gazebos, hammocks, waterfalls, ponds, forests, gardens, wildlife, you name it!  The garden was the brainchild of Dr. Raymond Webber, who originally purchased the property more than 27 years ago and intended to transform the abandoned rock quarry into a fishing haunt. Eventually, he added the various structures and more plant life. Cedar Lakes Woods opened to the public in 2014.	A peaceful, unique botanical garden complete with waterfalls, mini islands, and swans.
