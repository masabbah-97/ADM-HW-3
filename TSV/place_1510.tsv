Elwood beat out the former champ, Gnome Chomsky, a mini-golf course resident in upstate New York who was thought to be the tallest garden gnome in the world.However, an 18-foot-tall freak of kitschy nature was discovered in Poland, beating both of the American woodland giants. This European competitor was found just as Elwood was being created in a Wisconsin workshop, but unfortunately, Elwood was too far along in the design process to make him any taller. But all was not lost for Elwood, as the Polish gnome was found to be made of fiberglass as opposed to the Iowa gnome’s 3,500 pounds of rebar and concrete. So, his creators simply amended his title to “Largest Concrete Gnome in the World.” At least he beat Gnome Chomsky.	Beating out all other concrete competitors, this massive garden feature's pointy hat has earned it a world record.
