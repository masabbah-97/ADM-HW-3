Walkers can expect to find them tucked within the tangle of trees along the trail’s edge.Therese Ojibway, a special education teacher, started building and placing the fairy houses along the trail in 2011 to offer unexpected surprises for outdoor explorers. She originally added her miniature touches of magic anonymously, but revealed herself after ill-received imitation structures began popping in the area.	These mystical miniature houses bring a touch of magic to the New Jersey woods.
