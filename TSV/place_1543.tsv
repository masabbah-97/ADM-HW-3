From the high glass dome to the bright red brick foundation, the building is a thing of beauty. Since the walls are glass, the park’s lush green surrounds can also be appreciated in addition to whatever exhibition is on display inside. The palace is also outfitted with a boat landing on the waters of the park’s small lake and an entrance fitted out with classically styled columns. Since the palace is essentially an elaborate greenhouse it is no wonder that the first exhibition in the space was a display of exotic Vietnamese plants that were brought into Spain for the event. The intention was originally to continue displaying wondrous plants in the space, but as time went on the palace began showing more art than flora. Today, the Crystal Palace can still be visited by anyone who wants to take in the art on display inside or the natural vistas outside, or both at the same time.	Madrid's romantically ornate crystal palace has been offering shelter to plants and art for over a century.
