Over the years, the curious caverns have been host to numerous activities.IndigenousÂ tribes used the caves before the European settlers arrived in the area. In the 1840s, natural silica was mined from the cave for glass making.In the early 1900s, a French family formed a mushroom farm within their dank depths. The family later turned the location into a speakeasy during the days of Prohibition, naturally attracting less-than-legal business dealings and even a reported mob killing.The caves were turned into a disco in the 1970s and continued to be an event spot through 2019. The caves are, of course, also purported to be haunted by murdered gangsters and speakeasy patrons.	These curious caverns have been home to mushrooms, gangsters, and disco.
