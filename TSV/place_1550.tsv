They’re decorated with flowers, letters, names, lyrics, poems, and objects left by fans who have visited the place. Nostalgia surrounds the area, and it’s believed that Cobain used to sit there to write lyrics and spend some alone time.Locals gather at the bench every year on April 8, the anniversary of Cobain’s death, and some have tried to get the park’s name changed to honor the musician.Regardless of the park’s name though, the benches, surrounded by tall trees and green grass, provide good spots to sit and enjoy all the pretty songs in your headphones. 	A sliver of nostalgia in Seattle's Viretta Park.
