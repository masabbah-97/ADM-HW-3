While the entire country would later be amicably dissolved, the memory of the communist era is still survived by for those that lived it.For those that were not present for those times, the Museum of Communism was opened in 2001 by an American political science major who set out to collect relics and everyday artifacts from the country’s communist past from junk stores, flea markets, and other sellers of forgotten things. His collection, now curated by a Czech documentarian, includes such items as a statue of Lenin, a replica classroom from the era complete with eerie student mannequins, and propaganda posters that display the socialist-realism imagery of the time. 	This Prague museum collects brutalist relics and memories from the country's former Soviet rule.
