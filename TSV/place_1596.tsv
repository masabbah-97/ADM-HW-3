The facade we see from the street is essentially an enormous screened porch, one room deep in most places.The palace’s distinctive rosy color comes from the natural sandstone from which it is built which also gives Jaipur its nickname, “The Pink City.”The Palace of the Winds is considered one of the finest examples of Rajput architecture in India. 	The 953 windows undoubtedly make this the world's most beautiful screened porch.
