The pride and joy of the owner, former mortician Carl Crew, it’s claimed that the body is that of a failed U.S. clown leased by the owners.Scattered throughout the building are body parts, including skulls, bones, and petrified limbs. They take their place among other curios and oddities, including circus signage, man-eating monsters, screens showing clips from sci-fi and horror films, and more.
