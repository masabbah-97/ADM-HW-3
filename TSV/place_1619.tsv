The unique shape is the result of thousands of years of erosion by storm waves.Twenty-foot-tall trees and other vegetation have grown at the top of the isolated rock. Just west of the rock is the “thumbnail” (or “tip of the thumb”) rock, which is the most northern point on the “thumb” of Michigan.The surrounding land is privately owned, so visitors can only view the rock via boat or over the frozen lake in the winter.
