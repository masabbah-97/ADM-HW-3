Unlike more roaring falls, this waterwork flows over the apex of a fat, rounded stone, and is diverted into a sheet of countless small streams that issue from the bottom of the stone which juts out over the basin below.The otherworldly beauty of the site even earned it a place as the number one interesting waterfall in Romania.Update as of June 2021: The waterfall collapsed in part from natural causes. 	Moss and stone turn this waterfall into an otherworldly liquid veil.
