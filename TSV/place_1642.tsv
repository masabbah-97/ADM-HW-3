0	Gullivers Pizza	pizza,Unique Restaurants & Bars	386	1089	You will never get bored at this Chicagoland Pizzaria.With three locations, the 2727 Howard Street location is the place to go. The place is packed with gorgeous, museum quality pieces. There is also Victorian and Art Nouveau statues, bric a brac, and other random art everywhere. The food, the solid pub and bar grub, is great, but they also have really good pizza, both thin and stuffed as well as their signature pan.	Pizza with a side of fine art.
