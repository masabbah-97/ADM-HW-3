Atelier is the French word for “workshop” and the space reflects that feel with tea ingredients laid out for smelling and antique scales to measure out the ingredients. The owners have been known to trek to far-flung locations in search of the best ingredients.The shop was created by Heidi Johannsen Stewart, Michael Shannon, and Scott Stewart all of whom have backgrounds in style and product design which shows in both the distinct yellow tea containers and shop interior itself. There is even a pale pink sitting room in back where you can sip your tea in quiet comfort.They will be “cupping,” their word for providing free samples of tea, all day long, so be sure to stop in and try a cup of Noble Savage, Afghani Chai, or Wild Phoenix, just a few of their signature blends. 	"A charming ""tea atelier"" hidden away in Greenpoint, Brooklyn."
