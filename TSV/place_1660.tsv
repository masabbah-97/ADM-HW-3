People arrived by the trainload to bathe and bask in the healing waters in the late 1800’s. However, in 1902, the ultra-luxurious West Baden Hotel and Spa was built to house and serve visitors.With immaculate architecture and grounds, as well as first-class amenities, the resort quickly attracted wealthy travelers from around the world. The resort’s massive atrium, which features a 200-foot freestanding arch, was the largest in the United States until the construction of the Louisiana Super Dome.As interest in spa resorts faded during the Great Depression, the hotel took on a number of new faces. During the aftermath of the Depression, it was a Jesuit seminary, and eventually became a private college that Larry Bird briefly attended. After finally falling into serious disrepair for a number of years, several private investors took an interest in reviving the property.Recently, a brand new resort and casino were built adjacent to the property as part of a major $500 million renovation of the entire resort. West Baden Springs now houses two major resort hotels with full spa amenities, as well as a casino and lavish new accommodations, fortunately done without sacrificing the old world charm and opulence that defined the resort in the first place.	A turn-of-the-century architectural marvel built on healing mineral springs and salt licks.	West Baden Springs Hotel Library,Jug Rock,Virgil I.
