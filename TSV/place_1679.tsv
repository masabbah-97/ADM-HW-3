The canopy of the bush-cum-tree now covers nearly 5,000 feet of space and is elevated from the ground by a series of wooden and steel supports. Each year, after the shed husks are cleaned out from around the base of the tree, the plant blossoms with clusters of small white roses. As weather permits, visitors are welcome to visit the museum and spend a lunch beneath the scenic green roof. More information can be found on the Rose Tree Museum’s website http://tombstonerosetree.com	The world's largest rose bush has literally outgrown the pioneer museum it was planted behind.
