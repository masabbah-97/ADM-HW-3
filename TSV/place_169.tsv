At least that’s the myth at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, and whether or not it’s true, the Seid family has certainly perfected the art.For nearly 30 years, the Factory has been offering a cold treat and has grown wildly popular due to their unique flavors. Wasabi, black sesame and peanut butter and jelly are just a few of the one-of-a kind ice cream options at the Chinatown institution. Walking into the building, the ice cream case dares those who enter to step outside their chocolate chip box and enter a new world of Chinatown flavor.
