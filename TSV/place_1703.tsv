0	The Museum of Jurassic Technology	wonder cabinets,wunderkammers,strange science,natural history,outsider art,collections,museums	976	1066	You may be aware when you enter the museum that the appearance of anything that could be considered technology didn’t occur until about 150 million years after the Jurassic period. You may also note that artifacts of the Jurassic period, of natural history, or of technology are not in abundance in the museum. Rather than explain itself, the museum ignores the discrepancy.“In its original sense,” reads a Museum brochure, “The term museum meant a spot dedicated to the muses – a place where man’s mind could attain a mood of aloofness above everyday affairs.” This museum certainly is that spot. The displays evoke an 18th century cabinet of curiosities, ranging from micro-sculptures in the needle of an eye to “Garden of Eden on Wheels,” a collection devoted to trailer park culture. Many exhibits are confusing, nonsensical, or simply made up, but don’t expect to get answers. Just enjoy the sense of wonder.Don’t miss the life and works of Athanasius Kircher, a 17th century Jesuit scholar and “man of a hundred talents,” or the oddly moving portrait gallery of Soviet space dogs, all female, including Laika (barker), “the first ever earth-born creature to leave our planet and enter into the cosmic vacuum.”	A modern day curiosity cabinet.
