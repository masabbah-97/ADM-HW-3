Pelicans were first introduced to the park in 1664,  a generous gift from a Russian Ambassador. In 2013, three of the five Eastern Whites arrived as a gift from the city of Prague, joining the descendants of the original Russian flock.The pelicans can regularly be seen basking on rocks between 2:30 and 3:00 daily, when they are fed fish by the park rangers, when they aren’t sneaking into the London Zoo to pilfer the fish of their less free-range friends. The pelicans are extremely social, and quite used to human companionship — it’s not unusual for them to leave their lake to sit on the benches alongside bemused office workers and tourists.	Giant, friendly pelicans in Central London, the most unlikely of places.
