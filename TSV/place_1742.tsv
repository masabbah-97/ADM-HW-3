The vibe is part speciality store, part natural history museum.The store points out that the taxidermy is ethically sourced — a way of giving praise to an animal that would no longer be alive.  The collection is always huge, impressive, and well worth checking out. 	A Seattle oddities shop brimming with Victorian-era gems and antique curio.
