A note on the door, however, says that they “will return”.]In the bowels of the Circus Hostel in Berlin Mitte, Hoff-fanatics can pay homage to their idol at the world’s only David Hasselhoff museum.What started as a perhaps tongue-in-cheek shrine to the former Baywatch and Nightrider star has evolved into a full-blown one man museum celebrating the legend, his music and acting career, and of course his longstanding love affair with the once-divided city. Some credit David Hasselhof with contributing to Germany’s reunification after performing his unifying West German No. 1 hit, “Looking for Freedom” to jubilant crowds at the Berlin Wall at the iconic New Year’s Eve Celebration held in 1989, weeks after the wall had started to be taken down. The museum includes a mural of “The Hoff” himself, various photos of the actor, Baywatch and Nightrider paraphernalia, and a replica of the famous piano key scarf Hasselhof wore during his 1989 performance at the Berlin Wall.Whether a cheeky commendation or sincere glorification remains under debate, but one thing is for certain: David Hasselhoff, for good or bad, is synonymous with Berlin’s history, and the museum pays credit where credit is due. The Hostel management have even gone as far as to campaign to Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel to request the name of the street change to David-Hasselhoff-Strasse.It’s quite simply an unmissable stop for any Hoff fan or Berlin visitor looking for a uniquely Berlin story to take home.Update as of October 2021: The museum is currently closed indefinitely.  Update as of October 2022: Hostel and museum are open.
