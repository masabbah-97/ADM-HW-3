While Elwood’s story is suspect, the fabricated origin is perfectly in character for the shop which seems to celebrate pranks and hucksterism.The gift shop space contains a massive Bigfoot statue that greets customers and the shelves are jam-packed with weird pop artifacts, cheap gag toys, and creepy specimens. In the Peculiarium itself, the wide variety of exhibits include a nightmare dollhouse, a lot of very odd drawings and memorabilia, and even a trip inside a zombie’s brain. Photography is encouraged and there are great places for visitors to take selfies, including a seated, evil-looking Krampus with blazing red eyes and a life-size recreation of an alien autopsy. In addition to the items for sale, the space doubles as an art gallery, spotlighting talented local Portland artists who can hang their works among the bustling kitsch ephemera.  Ironically the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium’s most squirm-inducing attraction is not its fake severed body parts. They also serve fresh chocolate chip bug cookies, sprinkled with edible scorpions, mealworms, and crickets. Update as of February 1st, 2021: The Peculiaruim is closed indefinitely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 	An emporium for the weird, creepy, rare, and just plain gross.
