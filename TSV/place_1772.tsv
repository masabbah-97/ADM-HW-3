But one truck driver decided to change that.According to the county, the house was begun in 1950 and was built by Rudy and Ruth McLaughlin. Rudy was a long-haul truck driver who told his wife he would build her a castle - and did! It was heavy work – mortar and concrete for the roof was lifted in five-gallon buckets.The home is surrounded by a wrought iron fence and features gnomes – though some call them dwarfs and hence the name – guarding the lawn. A swimming pool surrounding the castle doubles as a moat. The two-bedroom house is a little over 1400 square feet and has two garages. The garages are only accessible via a drawbridge.As this is a private home, it is not open for tours–but it is still quite a curiosity to behold from the road.	A man's home is his castle.
