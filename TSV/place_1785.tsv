Upon closer inspection, what seemed to be fins are revealed to be painted metal monoliths planted in the ground at irregular angles and intervals creating a sense of live motion. The pieces are in fact decommissioned submarine wings that each weigh 10,000 pounds. This use of military ordinance to create public art which celebrates life is far more affecting than the simple title of Fin Art would suggest. 	Old submarine parts have been converted into faux whale fins.
