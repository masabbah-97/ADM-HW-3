0	Loved to Death	anthropomorphic,purveyors of curiosities,taxidermy,shops	1128	2755	For two seasons, the Science Channel reality TV show Oddities: San Francisco followed shop owner Audra Kunkle as she helped an organizer of Victorian-cemetery tea parties find a nose-related gift and searched for the perfect prop for identical twins’ robot-music performances. While the show has ended, the shop, Loved to Death, still offers curious antiques, jewelry, and artwork at its Haight-Ashbury location. The shop is full of memento mori and items with a goth or Victorian aesthetic. You’ll no longer find any animals on the walls, though—due to concerns about ethical sourcing, the shop has stopped offering taxidermy. If you’re not sure where to start, popular items include rings made with glass eyeballs and lucite specimens (imagine a real butterfly, preserved and presented in glass), many of which Kunkle makes upstairs in a small workspace.Update May 2021: Loved to Death’s brick-and-mortar location closed down in November 2020. The store is still operating, but now as an online-only business. More information can be found on the Loved to Death website.	This shop specializes in oddities and Victorian-inspired wonders.
