Nelson traveled to the Smithsonian in NYC and researched fossils to ensure the life-size replicas were as scientifically correct as possible. He would go on to construct 23 dinosaurs in total over the next 30 years. The largest sculpture in the park is the Brachiosaurus, which is an astounding 86 feet long and 46 feet tall! Once known for their bright, playful coloration, the dinosaur sculptures are now a bit faded and weathered, but still exciting for antediluvian enthusiasts nonetheless.The replicas are scattered along a trail through the surrounding coastal rainforest which convincingly mimics a primordial landscape with its giant ferns and constant damp humidity. The Prehistoric Garden is a terrific relic of times gone by, both ancient and modern.
