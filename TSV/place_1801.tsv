Despite his well-known maniacal sense of symmetry, the place is designed asymmetrical to be “lived” by the visitors in any space and any point of view, without a dominant perspective.There are some references to Anderson’s movies, too, such as the Steve Zissou and Castello Cavalcanti pinball machines. 	A Milanese café entirely designed by the American director Wes Anderson.
