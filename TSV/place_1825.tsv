0	Miniature Garden of Whimsy	miniatures,gardens,outsider art,plants	109	1026	Located just beneath the famed Japanese restaurant Yamashiro Hollywood, and a scant distance (a few dozen steps) west of its iconic giant golden Buddha, lies an enchanting collection of figurines, delicately placed amongst rock and stone formations, tropical flowers and driftwood sculptures.Nestled within the formations is a shrine to a deceased cat named Otto (many feral felines inhabit the area) and in keeping with the theme of the location, one will find a samurai doing battle with large crustaceans.Given that the garden is the passion project of a local neighbor, it’s ever-changing, and the creator can often be found tending to it in the morning with his scruffy little white dog. 	A quirky collection of figurines backdropped by city views is hidden next to a popular restaurant in the Hollywood hills.
