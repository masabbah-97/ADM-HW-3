Harter. While Alfred passed away several years ago, Stewart still resides in the Faerie Playhouse. The large wooden hearts that adorn the front of the house are said to be a tribute to his life partner, Alfred, who loved Valentine’s Day and all that it meant. Update as of April 2020: We regret to inform our community that Mr. Butler passed on March 5, 2020, at the age of 89.	A pink cottage covered in hearts served as a haven and a resting place for LGBTQ activists.
