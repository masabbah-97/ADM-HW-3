While the parsonage was built in 1681 (and first housed one George Burroughs, an unfortunate cleric who was later himself accused of witchcraft and hanged), it was torn down by the late 18th century in a state of near-collapse. Only the foundations—and a creepy neighborhood cat with a twitchy tail and eyes that follow you—remain today.To get here, take the little path that leads behind 67 Centre Street. It’s literally in someone’s backyard, but open to the public. If you don’t feel like fighting the crowds in downtown Salem for Halloween, slip off to Danvers instead, and get a glimpse of this strange and dark chapter of history without the incense and tour guides.	Located just behind a quiet residential neighborhood, this is ground zero for the Salem witchcraft hysteria of 1692.
