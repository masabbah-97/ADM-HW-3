Located in midtown Atlanta, the Center for Puppetry Arts houses The Jim Henson Collection, containing the largest presentation of Jim Henson artifacts in the world. Henson was the man behind The Muppets, Sesame Street, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal and more. The collection is an interactive journey through the history of his most iconic creations, including Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog, and more. The center is also home to The Global Collection, which celebrates the cultural diversity of puppetry from around the world. This exhibit includes everything from historical puppet art-forms like Vietnamese Water Puppets to Broadway theatre puppets (hello, Lion King!) to modern day Hollywood stop-motion.At the center, you can also watch movies, learn how to make puppets, and attend seasonally themed balls. The Center for Puppetry Arts is a wonderful journey through childhood nostalgia, perfect for the family.	The largest puppetry museum in the USA houses the world's most complete collection of Jim Henson artifacts.
