She was chosen to design an entire series of sculptures based on characters from the Dr Seuss universe, as well as a likeness of the man himself. For Dimond-Cates it was a chance to pay tribute to her stepfather Ted Geisel—or as the rest of the world knew him—Dr. Seuss. The life-size bronzes stand in the center of the quadrangle formed by the Springfield Museums. The Grinch, Cat in the Hat, Yertle the Turtle, Sam-I-Am, and the Lorax, are all there, scattered around the different sections of the garden. This project to build a national memorial to the storyteller began in 1996, and the the sculpture garden was opened in 2002.In 2017, Springfield Museums also opened an entire museum dedicated to Dr Seuss’s life and work, right next to the sculpture garden. 	Life-size bronzes of the Grinch, Cat in the Hat, Yertle the Turtle, Sam-I-Am, and the Lorax—and the author himself.
