The red-roofed, yellow-sided house where most of the film takes place is located at 303 Point Road in Hancock and still looks the same.The human cemetery featured at various points throughout the movie is Mount Hope Cemetery at 1048 State Street in Bangor. It was here that Stephen King cameos in the movie as a minister presiding over a funeral. The exact spot can be found on the State Street side of the cemetery, right up against a steep hill with a stone staircase cut into it. It was on the side of that steep hill, to the left of a set of stairs if you’re ascending them and around the vicinity of the Bragg plot, where the father disinters his son.
