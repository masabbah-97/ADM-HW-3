The larger of the makeshift ships is on the bottom, built with all the amenities an interstellar traveler might need such as a toilet, shower, television, and air conditioning. The smaller of the ramshackle saucers simply rests atop the other with no connecting bolts. According to aspiring galactic ambassador Pendarvis, this will allow for it to be moved easier by alien technology.The ships look a little rundown these days, but Pendarvis, who stays in the ship when the temperature goes above 55 degrees (F) because it has better AC than his trailer, still holds out hope for alien visitors. However human visitors are allowed to tour the UFO Welcome Center if they are able to reach Pendarvis and pay his ever increasing entry fee. Simply look for the words, “UFO Welcome Center” spray-painted on the fence. If aliens can find it, so can explorers. 	This set of rickety spaceships are prepared to give alien travelers a place to relax and go to the bathroom.
