Another mural depicts a more medieval scene, a scantily clad warrior-woman rides a dragon into battle, and among the devil and nymph statues, a centaur rears up, bow and arrow in hand. This jumble of myths and fantasy artwork is not a haunted house or a film prop retailer, but simply the not-so-humble apartment building of two free spirits who rent to artists, musicians, and other like-minded folk that don’t mind their home being gawked at.El Bordello Alexandra used to be just that – a rumored bordello and heroin den with a slumlord that had little interest in caring for the historical 2-story building. When Tony and Brittany purchased the apartments over a decade ago, they gutted the promising structure and started from scratch. After the initial repair work was done, the two started hiring local artists to make it a place worthy of the label “bizarre” in a city that flies its freak flag so high it’s barely visible. Worthy it is. With its contrasting themes all represented with bold-colored murals, life-sized statues and some of the busiest detail in town, El Bordello Alexandra has managed to stand out in a place where it’s practically impossible to earn a double-take.	An increasingly eccentric apartment building, topped with winged beasties.
