He travels, giving lectures and workshops on the trees. His personal collection, at Elandan Gardens in Washington state, features of over 200 bonsai trees arranged among ponds, waterfalls, and rock sculptures. It has become a major draw for horticulture lovers.His trees have been gathered over the course of his life from all kinds of environments, from mountains and marshes to areas ravaged by logging to old nurseries. The ages are determined by counting the rings on clippings of the roots or branches through microscopes.Â Japanese Maples and giant rhododendrons help fill out the rest of Elandan Gardens, which also has a gallery and a stunning view of the Sinclair Inlet on the Puget Sound.
