Among the strangest items in the museum is Dr. Ralph Bingenpurge “County Food Inspector,” an automaton built to continuously vomit onto a pile of old bottles.Collected over the last 50 years by pharmacist Marvin Yagoda, who passed away in early 2017, the collection requires more than one visit to fully appreciate.	Astounding collection of coin-operated games and automata.
