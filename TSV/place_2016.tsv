The first bridge was constructed to allow workers from the Trift hydroelectric plant to access a power plant that was built below the glacier to collect and use the run off. A few short years after the original bridge was built, the second, sturdier model was hung across the wide ravine and the site was opened to the public. Currently the bridge spans a vertigo-inducing almost 560 foot gap in the mountains, suspended over 300 feet from the valley floor. Unlike some of its more primitive inspirations, the Trift bridge is made of thick steel cables over which wooden planks have been bolted. Despite the modern construction it still looks like a death trap.  While the bridge itself is an impressive site to visit, the journey to span is harrowing in and of itself requiring a cable car trip, which also carries visitors high above the ground.	This amazing pedestrian suspension bridge in the Swiss Alps would give Indiana Jones nightmares.
