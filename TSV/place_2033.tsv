During the summer it’s home to the largest and northern-most colony of Mexican free-tail bats and groups of fireflies that dot the night sky.The facility itself is quite also noteworthy. The entire hot springs complex is off the grid, powered completely by the hot water that also forms the springs. A hydroelectric plant provides all of the electricity, and the cabins on site take advantage of geothermal activity.Other attractions include the abandoned iron mine the land trust was originally named after, natural limestone caves and historic building. With free camping, a family friendly atmosphere, a diverse set of regulars, and a dedication to open space preservation, Valley View has served as relaxing retreat off the beaten path.	Community owned and operated, this property is home to a diverse set of nudists.
