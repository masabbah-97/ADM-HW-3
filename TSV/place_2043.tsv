Though she was arrested for an outstanding warrant, a decade later she would be put to death for the murder of six men.Wuornos has become a controversial figure. She was clearly a complicated, tragic figure (she grew up poor and sexually abused, claimed that the murders she committed were in self-defense as her johns attempted to rape her, and was poorly represented by an attorney who called himself “Dr. Legal”), and she was depicted this way in the 2003 film Monster. Given the rarity of female serial killers, Wuornos’ case gained widespread media attention, but she also became famous for her last words before her 2002 execution: “Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and I’ll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I’ll be back, I’ll be back.”Since the incident, not much has changed at The Last Resort. It’s still frequented by bikers, and features a “Japanese garden” of motorcycles dangling from an old oak. However, the decor has been altered to remember Wuornos’ last drink here. Pictures of her plaster the walls, including her mug shot. A mural on the bar’s brick wall depicts her craggy face and a list of her victims. Perhaps less tastefully (but more tastily) the bar has also branded its own “Crazed Killer Hot Sauce.”	Where serial killer Aileen Wuornos drank her last beer.
