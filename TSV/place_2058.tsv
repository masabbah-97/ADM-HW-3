So Johnny Diablo, the restaurant’s owner, decided to rebrand Pirates Tavern into something less conventional.Aside from serving vegan food, the club prohibits its dancers from wearing fur, feathers, leather, or wool while performing. The establishment has been criticized and even sued by people claiming it trades the exploitation of animals for the exploitation of women. 	Is this the most Portland place ever?
