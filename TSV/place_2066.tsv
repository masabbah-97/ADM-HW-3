The tunnel is large enough that there was a recent fire that started within the tunnel that grew large enough to destabilize the cave and the road overhead.Montgomery Bell Tunnel was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1981.Update: As of 2017, parts of the inside of the tunnel have collapsed and it is no longer possible to walk through. While it is still accessible to view via the hiking trails, the swimming area below the falls now has No Swimming signs posted and the tunnel itself has a sign reading “hazardous, keep out”.	The first full-scale tunnel built in America is short but scenic.
