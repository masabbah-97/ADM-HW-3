But step inside, and you’ll steal a quick peek at the space where William Faulkner himself lived while in the city.Though he later penned famous works like The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying, Faulkner wasn’t much of anybody yet when he moved to New Orleans, and in fact published his first work in a local journal. There is a historical plaque outside the building that states that Faulkner wrote his first novel, Soldiers’ Pay, while in residence there in 1925.Inside, the small store has a good selection of literary fiction ranging from classics to current publications. There is also a great selection of books about New Orleans and local culture. There is, of course, a dedicated area, almost shrine-like, for Faulkner’s works, and the shop owner will let you take a look at those more expensive books, “if you want to get in trouble with your wallet.”The space is also reportedly haunted by none other than the author himself, people sometimes reporting a strong aroma of pipe tobacco (something he was known for), and some have even claimed to see him at his writing desk, which is still right there in the store.
