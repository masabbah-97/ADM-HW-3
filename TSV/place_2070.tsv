Maple trees flash their crimson leaves in the fall, and in the winter the conservatory keeps its tropical plants, orchids, and succulents warm.Founded in 1924, the nearly 60-acre Kyoto Botanical Garden nurtures some 120,000 plants on its grounds. After falling into disuse in 1945, it reopened in 1961 and today is Japan’s oldest and most comprehensive botanical garden.The conservatory isn’t just a nice spot to keep warm on a winter garden tour; at nearly 50,000 square feet (4,612 square meters) it is one of Japan’s largest conservatories as well. The garden also has a children’s play area, a flower stand where you can purchase your own piece of plant life, and a small cafe. The gardens provide a space to escape to from the hustle of Kyoto’s busy attractions, to find solitude, or to simply appreciate the beauty of plants. 	With over 12,000 different species of plants, this botanical garden is Japan's oldest and most diverse.
