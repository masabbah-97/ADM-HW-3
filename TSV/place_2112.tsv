As he laid in bed, he spoke his last words: “Well, I’ll be damned. This is funny,” referencing his barefoot state, for no one had anticipated Doc meeting Death in such a relaxed fashion.Today, his headstone can be viewed in the Linwood Cemetery in which he is buried, though the exact spot of his plot remains unknown.	Even in death, he's still your huckleberry.
