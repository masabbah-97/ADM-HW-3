0	Le Cercueil (The Coffin)	horror,bars,Unique Restaurants & Bars	450	935	The gruesome ambience of this bar offers the drinker an immersive macabre lesson in hell-bent bar-hopping. Le Cercueil was unleashed onto the world in 1974 following the release of the horror movie, “The Exorcist.” The decor, featuring grim reapers and dark skeletons, creates a morbid atmosphere in this unique tavern. The only thing creepier than placing your skull-shaped beer mug on a coffin is the nomenclature of the cocktails. Sit back and sip on your choice of corpse juice, devil’s sperm, and vampire blood. The bar offers a speed-dating service but beware, the ultraviolet neon lights give potential lovers an eerie corpse-like appearance.	The Devil’s own choice when he needs a drink in Brussels.
