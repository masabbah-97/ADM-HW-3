A modern excavation done in the 1990s revealed that the area was heaped with bodies, some basically piled in mass graves. Even more grisly, the excavation led to the discovery that more than 40 percent of the graves were fetuses, or infants under the age of one. Researchers also discovered that bodies in the cemetery had come into contact with a number of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, and Paget’s disease.Today, the horrors of the cemetery are recognized and remembered each Halloween and the site now houses an unofficial memorial garden, although most of it remains under concrete. The red fence outside it is densely decorated with tributes in the form of flowers and ribbons and the names of those buried and left to be forgotten. 	This South London cemetery holds the remains of more than 15,000 people.
