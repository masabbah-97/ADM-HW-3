In addition to its many hands-on exhibits, the museum is also known for its lovely, if slightly kitschy, dioramas and miniature dinosaur tableaus.The brainchild of Cliff Miles—the man who named the Gargoyleosaurus, Hesperosaurus, and Minotaurasaurus and was the adviser for the Jurassic Park films—the facility also features an IMAX 3D theater and a working paleontological laboratory, where visitors can observe preservation work up-close.
