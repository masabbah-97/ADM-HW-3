There is a recreation trail that winds visitors up to an observation point for a full view of the gorgeous rocks from above.The rocks’ sharp tips that widen into conical-shaped bases, which gives them the distinct appearance of a teepee. The monument is a little isolated but it is not too hard to find. The area also offers a good opportunity to view the life and history of native people along with the natural majesty of the stone mountains. The monument is a unit of the BLM’s National Landscape Conservation System.  	A unique geological area spiked with wind-carved rocks that resemble teepees.
