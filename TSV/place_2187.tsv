0	Webb Gallery	outsider art,museums and collections	150	928	Born in Waxahatchie, Texas, in 1987, the Webb Gallery is known for specializing in outsider art and the artifacts of secret societies. The collection, which overflows with curiosities, has gained an international following because of the strength behind its curation and its personality.“What started as a passion/obsession for old handmade items such as painted or repaired objects, fraternal lodge items, carnival banners, tramp art, memory jugs, quilts, and just killer oddball stuff became a continuous quest for the unusual,” is how the the Webb Gallery’s official website explains its early beginning. “The Webbs have been crisscrossing Texas, the South, the Midwest and just about any hole in the wall across the country in search of the miraculous for more than a decade.”Those travels have turned up an amazing collection of goods. Bruce and his wife amassed so much stuff that they started curating exhibits in school, universities, and museums around the country while also lecturing on what they learned during their exploration. The Webb Gallery is now housed in a 10,000-square-foot building 30 miles south of Dallas that’s hard to miss because of its cast iron front. In addition to hosting the Webb’s current collection of art, the center hosts events, musical performances, speakers, and more.	It specializes in outsider art and artifacts of secret societies.
