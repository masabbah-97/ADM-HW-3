There is no one entrance to the Underground, but rather many secret entrances scattered throughout downtown. Opened in 1974, it was originally called the ‘Conncourse’ in honor of Jack Conn, an Oklahoma City banker. The series of tunnels stretches for about a mile underground and includes a plethora of stores, shops, and even a post office.The tunnels are color coded in a variety of neon (pink, lime, orange, yellow, light blue, purple, green, red, and blue), and each color represents a wing, which corresponds to a gallery. There are several glass skyways between buildings without underground connections. Many of the secret entrances are in the basements and parking garages of big buildings. The Sheraton Hotel’s basement is one of the more popular and accessible tunnels, but the Banc First Building has access to a larger number of tunnels. Simply take the elevator to the basement. From there, you’ll find an underground cafe, a post office, and a barber shop on your way to a tunnel lined with green fluorescent lights. That tunnel takes you to a yellow tunnel, which leads to an underground Chinese restaurant.	Travel through the hidden underbelly of the city in colorful tunnels filled with art and history exhibits.
