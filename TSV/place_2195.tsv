A “hands on” museum, every exhibit is also playable, free of charge with your entry fee. One of the oldest pinball machines in the collection is the “Screwball” which dates to 1948 when the flippers were made to point outwards. One of the early machines with flippers they were added as part of the movement of pinball machines from pure gambling devices to games of skill. Started with a small collection of 10 pinball machines donated by board member Steve Bowrey, the museum has grown extensively over the years. A labor of love, much of the work done on the machines as well as building out the handcrafted bar was done by volunteers who contributed $2,500 in time and labor rather than cash.	This collection of over 50 classic pinball machines awaits visitors to downtown Roanoke.
