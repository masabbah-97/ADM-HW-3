They are not good at it. This set of steps still exists in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles, and to this day is commemorated by both a marble plaque explaining the location’s significance and a street sign marking the site. Locals and tourists alike can visit the public walkway, although they are advised to leave their pianos at home.	The site of a classic series of Laurel and Hardy pratfalls.
