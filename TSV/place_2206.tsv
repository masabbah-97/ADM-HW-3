Pour out water and it runs up hill, cars roll up hill too. While repaving changed the effect somewhat, it still works - particularly at night. There are hundreds of local folklore reasons why it occurs. The event starts roughly 50 yards up the hill (east) from the Old Fort Road gravel quarry on the right, down the hill approx. 3/8 of a mile down from the site of a WWII military medical base at the crest of the hill.Â Update: As of August 2019, the strange occurrence on this stretch of road has been fixed by the state of Oregon.	This strange hill on Old Fort Road where gravity works in reverse has been fascinating locals for years.
