He was known to go out of his way to purchase oysters to feed the cat, even to the point of annoying his servants by his pampering of his pets.After Hodge’s death, the poet Percival Stockdale wrote “An Elegy on the Death of Dr Johnson’s Favourite Cat”:“Who, by his master when caressed / Warmly his gratitude expressed; / And never failed his thanks to purr / Whene’er he stroked his sable fur.”The bronze statue to Hodge by sculptor Jon Bickley was installed in 1997 by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Roger Cook, outside Johnson’s house at Number 17 Gough Square where he lived from 1748 to 1759, now a museum dedicated to the writer’s life. Hodge is shown sitting on top of Johnson’s dictionary and next to some empty oyster shells. The monument is inscribed with the words “a very fine cat indeed.”	Dictionary Johnson’s favorite feline.
