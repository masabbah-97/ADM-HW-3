They generally have two cars that are counter-balanced, so one car goes up by the force of gravity pulling on the other car going down. And the up-car returns the favor by controlling the weight of the down-car. They’ve been around for hundreds of years, efficiently moving both people and materials with their simple cable-pulley system, and many urban versions were built all over the United States in the second half of the 19th century. There are lots of funiculars still around in many other parts of the world (Quebec has a famous one – Norway, Hong Kong, Spain – anywhere people need to get up and down steep hills), and the two in Pittsburgh have fueled decades of debates about which is better. With both still open to the public, and only about a mile apart, you can ride up one and down the other and decide for yourself.	There aren't too many operational funiculars around, but Pittsburgh has two!	Robot Hall of Fame,Fort Pitt Blockhouse,The Immaculate Reception Monument	1197 W.
