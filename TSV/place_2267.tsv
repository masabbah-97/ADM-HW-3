But perhaps the crowning jewel of Graceland’s quirk is the Jungle Room.Elvis added his tropical man cave to his mansion in the mid-’60s. Its jungle atmosphere came complete with a built-in rock waterfall and green shag carpet, and he furnished it with ferns and lacquered wood furniture. It was the ultimate at-home tiki bar. Elvis called the Jungle Room “The Den.” The name Jungle Room was coined when Graceland opened to the public in 1982. The Jungle Room also became the King’s final recording studio, where he recorded much of his last two albums.Graceland could be considered the mecca of American mid-century kitsch, but the Jungle Room is truly its best signifier. Its tropical trimmings are reminders of a bygone trend in luxury, now largely considered silly and over-the-top. It was allegedly a favorite place of Elvis’ and his family’s, and the room’s tiki vibe is said to have reminded him of his time spent in Hawaii.	Elvis's own personal tropical hideaway.
