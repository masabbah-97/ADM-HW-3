Gordon has since added landscaping—grasses, aloe, and succulents—and slews of sculptures by at least two dozen artists, including himself.Winding around the pathways, which are embedded with elaborate stone designs, visitors encounter psychedelic mannequins, turtles made from mangled woks, and a riot of neon.You might bump into one of the artists at work—they come and go from the studios scattered around the house, and there’s even an open-air workshop out front. Piano parts, iron rods, and scores of other materials are everywhere, waiting to be summoned them into commission. The art party continues to rage inside. If you call in advance, Gordon may be at home and available to show you around. Indoors, you’ll see the paint-splashed railings and mammoth gemstones, built up piece by piece with strong glue. If he offers you 3-D glasses, put them on to see his acrylic works wriggle. The whole vibe changes at night, when the garden is illuminated by glowing orbs and squiggly strands of lights. Since the gallery is always evolving, it’s worth a repeat visit.	This collector's home is a constant work in progress.
