0	Papal Hearts at Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi	hearts,relics,relics and reliquaries,churches,sacred spaces	331	898	In 2002, Pope John Paul II gifted use of Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi in Rome to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, but 22 hearts of the popes remain in the marble urns.The popes are listed to the left of the altar and their reigns range from Sixtus V in 1583 to Leo XIII in 1903. The custom of separating the organs from the corpse was called praecordia and was done to prevent decay while funeral arrangements were made.There is a large collection of ex voto in this church, most depicting the Sacred Heart. These are small metal ornaments that are left by the faithful as a token of thanks when their prayers are answered.The church faces the more famous Trevi Fountain. As with many churches in Italy, the dress code is strictly enforced. Bare shoulders and knees are prohibited.	This former Roman Catholic Church still contains the embalmed hearts and organs of 22 popes.
