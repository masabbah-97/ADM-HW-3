However by late in the 13th century, the repeated fires had sent a message to the local builders and it was replaced with a stone bridge ended by large stone churches at either terminus of the span. By the 15th century the vaulted bridge was one of the only constructions to survive another fire, this time one that destroyed much of the surrounding city of Erfurt. After this, the current buildings were built atop either side of the narrow bridge. All told, 62 narrow houses were built atop the bridge, each carrying about three storeys.The constructions have survived to the present day, although the houses have been converted to around 32 living and commercial spaces. The ground level storefronts are mainly antique and artisan shops while the upper levels of the building are still private residences. The bridge homes are the jewel of the city which celebrates their claim to fame each year with a festival centered on the little community called Krämerbrückenfest.  	This historic stone bridge has an entire neighborhood clinging to its sides.
