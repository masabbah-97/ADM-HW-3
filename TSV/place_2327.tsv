The shop also plays host to a small library of mystical books and other oddities spanning the world obscura. Curia Arcanum shares the property with another curiosity shop, The Glass Coffin: Vampire Parlour, making this location a two-for-one tribute to the weirder side of Austin.	This eclectic Austin curiosity shop is home to all things strange and unusual.
