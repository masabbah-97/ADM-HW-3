For Twin Rocks, Oregon the choice was remarkably easy. Offshore from the seven miles of pristine sands on Rockaway Beach are two enormous 100-foot-high rocks, made of 20-30 million year old sandstone which was over time forced up into a ridge of sandstone. As time and the ocean wore away at the ridge it left the harder pieces behind in the form of twin rocks. The twin rocks are also the site of a rather unusual burial service offered by Twin Rocks Undersea Memorial in which ones loved ones ashes are set out to sea.
