There are also baked goods, usually at the tables of shows with kids in the cast.For much of the day, stars sit at an autograph table set up at Junior’s Restaurant. At the auction, fans can bid on things like autographed sheet music, opening night tickets, lunches with stars, and walk on roles in shows.The market started in 1987 when cast members of A Chorus Line set up tables outside of their stage door to raise money for friends with HIV/AIDS. It has since expanded, and the money raised benefits Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, which supports health organizations across the country. Over the last 30 years, the event has raised $12.6 million.	An annual extravaganza of Broadway theater memorabilia.
