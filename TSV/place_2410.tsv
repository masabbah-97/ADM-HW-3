This is Prometheus Esoterica, Winter Park’s own little oddity shop and gothic boutique. Whether you are shopping for taxidermy needs or looking to add some herbs to your apothecary, Prometheus Esoterica is a must-stop for anyone passing through the Orlando area. 	Hidden in the back of this quaint vintage store is an amazing little oddities shop.
