Its history as a gold mining town gives it an Old West appeal that draws visitors up the hair-raising mountain roads and onto its frontier-style Main Street.On this Main Street, you’ll find a recreation of one of the American frontier’s weirdest, most wonderful institutions: the alchemist’s shop.The Ouray Alchemist shop attempts to recreate a frontier-era pharmacy, although its current iteration only dates back to 2002. The pharmacy sells over the counter goods, but its truly unusual glory can only be experienced on a guided tour. Beautifully ornate medicine bottles, antiquated medical equipment, and stomach-churning remedies are all on display here.  	A recreation of an Old West apothecary full of curios.
