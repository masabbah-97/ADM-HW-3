In many ways, its one of the only streets where you can really find anything.Of course this also applies to dining, and Kenka fits the bill in a distinctly St. Marks fashion. Many of the dishes at Kenka don’t seem like traditional Japanese fare, and are a far cry from tempura and sushi. However, the exotic plates here are a perfect foreign meal for adventure-seeking appetites.	Make a tough dinner decision: Octopus wasabi roulette or bull penis?
