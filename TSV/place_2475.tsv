Every summer, Berliners flock to lakes, numerous public swimming pools, as well as city beaches, strung like beads along the Spree river as it cuts right through the city center.Unfortunately, the Spree river itself is too polluted and too frequently used by ships to ensure safe swimming. Luckily, there is still the chance to bathe at the river without touching its filthy waters. The Badeschiff (literally Bathing Ship), moored near the eastern city center, is a large swimming pool, which was built inside the hollowed hull of an anchored vessel.The pool was designed by Susanne Lorenz as part of a competition for city arts projects, and was inaugurated in May 2004. Since then, the Badeschiff has become a favorite among Berliners and tourists alike trying to escape the mid-summer’s heat.During the summer months, an open air bar, sunbathing area, massages and sports classes are available at the pool’s location as well. After the summer season, a cocoon-like temporary roof is being built over the pool and the surrounding area, which holds two saunas and a lounge bar. The location also hosts regular concerts and parties, making it a year-round center for activity in Berlin.	Floating swimming pool within a moored vessel.
