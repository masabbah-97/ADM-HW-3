He wanted to build a beachside dream getaway for his large LA-based family, and in 1911, the craftsman style home was completed.When two of Abbot Kenney’s sons married two of Warren Wilson’s daughters, their families became inextricably linked.Now a small hotel that is rumored to always smell like cookies baking, Venice Beach House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Be sure to reserve the wool-plaid upholstered  Abbot Kinney Room.	Two men, two visionaries of Venice Beach, one little hotel that smells like cookies.
