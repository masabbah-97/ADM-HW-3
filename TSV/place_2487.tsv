This secluded sliver of the city is basically an invitation for wearied adults to unleash their inner child.There are five normal swings made of halved tires, two tire swings (one vertical, one horizontal), and a handicap accessible plastic blue swing large enough for adults with rubberized subsurface instead of sand so it’s wheelchair accessible. The entire area is carpeted with soft sand and lined with wooden benches for non-swinging visitors.When you’ve got an hour to burn before your dinner reservation, it’s the perfect place to bring your group, whether it’s a first date, a friendly gathering, or a family affair. Once you’re done swinging, there are plenty of nearby places for a stroll. Cross the bridge’s pedestrian walkway or venture below toward the path that curves along the Riverwalk. At the very least, it’s a cool place to just rewind and take in Brew City.	An off-the-beaten-path place to literally hang beneath Milwaukee's Holton Street Bridge.
