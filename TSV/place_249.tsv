0	Greenacre Park	pocket parks,gardens,parks,natural wonders,plants,nature	734	2452	At only 1/7 acre, this is one of the smallest hidden parks in the city, but it provides a nice lush place to relax and take a break from the urban landscape.The crowning feature of the pocket park is the 25-foot waterfall, which is not only stunning, but also roars away the city noise so you’re left in a calming oasis. The park was constructed in 1971 by the Greenacre Foundation after a design by Hideo Sasaki, but it feels fresh even decades later where the honey locust trees and rare Midtown calm lure people to linger in its shade. 	Read a book next to a Midtown waterfall.
