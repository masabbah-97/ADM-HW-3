0	Old Warner Bros. Theatre Inside Downtown Jewelry Exchange	diamonds	348	857	If you squint at the diamond on the Downtown Jewelry Exchange you’ll notice its shape looks an awful lot like the Warner Brothers shield.That’s because the former Warner Bros. Downtown Theatre is still intact inside the Downtown Jewelry Exchange. And instead of destroying the Warner Brothers shield on the marquee the Downtown Jewelry Exchange replaced it with a conveniently similarly shaped diamond. There is also still a red curtain inside, you can see the projectors from the balcony, gold chandeliers, and more.	The beautiful 1920 Pantages Theatre remains hidden just underneath the LA Downtown Jewelry Exchange.
