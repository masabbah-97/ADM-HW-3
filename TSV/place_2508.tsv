Other parts are “borrowed” remnants from the nearby Hearst Castle, where Beal worked for a time. The massive Nitt Witt Ridge includes stone arches and walkways, long decks and strange gardens, and emphasizes Beal’s great sense of humor and love of nature.	A house built from trash known as the poor man's Hearst Castle.
