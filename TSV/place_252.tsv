A smashing success, the Violet Hour’s exquisite high-end cocktails were designed by acclaimed New York City mixologist Toby Maloney, and its employees have gone on to open numerous posh establishments throughout the city. The Violet Hour is a recipient of the 2015 James Beard award for outstanding bar program.The lack of clear signage is a Violet Hour trademark, as is the long line to get in at most times. Their $13 sippers provide an excellent tonic with which to mull over the changing nature of urban spaces.	A speakeasy takes on Chicago's drinking culture.
