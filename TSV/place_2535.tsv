The plants, which hug either side of the narrow walkway across the bridge, are labeled to satisfy the curiosity of interested visitors.The bridge was built for trolleys in 1908. In 1929, after the railway went out of business, the structure was reborn as the Bridge of Flowers. In 1983, it was completely renovated at a cost of a half-million dollars and under the expertise of a local horticulturalist. Today, its upkeep relies on a paid gardener and volunteer help from the Shelburne Falls Women’s Club.	An old trolley bridge was converted into a breathtaking garden bursting with colorful flowers.
