Photographs show the severely distended testicles of the unfortunate human host of a tropical bug. Nearby, a giant herpetological parasite pokes out of a bottled turtle’s head. The museum has over 45,000 immersed and prepared parasite specimens in its collection.But the prize attraction is undoubtedly the world’s longest tapeworm - all 8.8 metres of it - accompanied by a rope the same length that you can “play with” to get a real “feel” for its dimensions. The small gift shop sells a cheery range of parasite-themed T-shirts, keyrings, and birthday cards.	Meet the world's longest tapeworm in a collection that really gets under your skin.
