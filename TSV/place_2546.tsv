This original, known as the “first basilica” was rediscovered in the 1860s during excavations. This long-sealed first basilica holds the world’s second largest collection of early Medieval wall paintings.One layer further into the earth are the remnants of a first century Roman villa that served as both an early site of clandestine Christian worship that also contains a Mithraic temple and a babbling stream.Update July, 2017: Restoration work  is obscuring a good portion of the modern basilica’s interior.
