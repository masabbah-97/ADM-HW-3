Dozens of escaped monkeys scampered into the woods. The local farmers had never seen such creatures before, and set out to shoot and kill every single one in what would become a legendary monkey massacre.An anonymous artist created a set of monkey statues to commemorate the dark moment in the area’s history. Supposedly, the unknown sculptor wanted his creations to send a message that not understanding something is not a reason to want to destroy it.The concrete primates, which honor the victims of the massacre, can be found along the Forest Trail at the Autrey Mill Nature Preserve in Johns Creek. Though they’re typically arranged in a circle, their exact location does tend to occasionally change.	The statues commemorate the legendary mass killing of escaped circus monkeys.
