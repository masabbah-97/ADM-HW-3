Bush at the Minister’s Palace in Baghdad, a hot water coil heater from Kaunas, Lithuania, and a plastic glove from Paradise Valley, Montana.The collection is refreshed annually. In 2018, a small “gift shop” was added in a window a few feet down on the right of the Mmuseumm. Visitors may call an 800 number to access a free audio guide. The museum fits three people at a time.
