Whole communities were razed, and roads and train tracks needed to be rerouted.  As part of this rerouting, a tunnel was built for the Boston and Maine Railroad.The .2-mile long tunnel ran underneath a hill to the northeast of the reservoir.In the 1930s, freight traffic along the route began to dwindle, and by the late 1950s, both freight and passenger service had ceased. By the end of the 1970s, the railroad bridge that crossed over Route 62 and the Nashua River was taken down. The tunnel remains, intact, in the woods along route 62.  In the years since its abandonment, it has been covered in graffiti. The inside of the tunnel is said to create an optical illusion, by which it seems to go on forever when you walk through it.	Now abandoned and graffiti-covered, this railroad tunnel was once the longest in Massachusetts.
