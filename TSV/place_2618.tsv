In reality, this often means art made by the clinically insane, hermits, criminals, or obsessive-compulsive individuals.The Museum of Everything has a fascinating collection and is a peek into the mind of madmen, and next to each artist’s works is a commentary by a well-known contemporary artist.The museum is located in the Primrose Hill area of London, a short walk from the Camden Town markets and Regent’s ParkAs of 2012, the Museum of Everything is closed and sometimes holds temporary exhibits in other venues, such as its 2011 exhibit in Selfridges.	London's largest outsider art museum.
