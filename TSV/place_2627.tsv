Built in 1914, the houses have withstood the test of time—and the inevitability of urban development—in this popular West Seattle neighborhood. Stone purchased the houses in 1989 after moving from Hawaii, and credits the islands as inspiration for her homes’ colorful outdoor bounty. Red, purple, and pink blooms riot among the emerald green that hangs from every window box. Below, a public water fountain and driftwood swing offer refreshment to those looking to take a load off.The houses are officially registered as a wildlife habitat by the National Wildlife Federation. Stone enjoys visitors of all kinds to her garden oasis: on top of the birds, bees, and butterflies, she welcomes any curious traveler to share in her vision and take in the view.	Every summer West Seattle experiences a housing bloom.
