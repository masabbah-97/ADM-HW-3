Today, you can find a wide array of beans that overwhelm with their enticing aromas from distant lands such as Ethiopia, Cuba, Kenya, Colombia, Java, and more. The coffees range from Kona, a rare variety from the volcanic soils of Hawaiʻi’s Big Island, to the precious, pricey Jamaican Blue Mountain. If you are more of a tea person, there are also hundreds of varieties, from Japanese Genmaicha green tea to Indian Nilgiri Pekoe tea to good, old Argentinian mate.If you can’t wait to take your leaves or beans home and need to satisfy your caffeine fix immediately, the shop also makes espresso and cappuccino. While there is no sit-down area, the drinks—at £1 and £1.20 respectively—are some of the cheapest you’ll find in the city.	Since 1887, this old-school shop has stacked its shelves with extraordinary coffees and teas.
