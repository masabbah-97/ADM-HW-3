This area is squarely located in what is known ancestrally as Chickasaw land.  The son of French Canadian nobles, Timothy Demonbreun disregarded his titles and took up the life of a simple fur trader in Tennessee. After finding a spot along the Cumberland that attracted a great deal of game, he chose to stay in the remote area and establish himself, but with no man-made shelter around, he holed up in a small cave. The first resident of European descent in what is now Nashville, Demonbreun used this cave as a temporary home for several months while pursuing his livelihood as a fur trader and building a more suitable residence. Later a successful merchant and tavern keeper, this “First Caucasian Citizen of Nashboro” still has many descendants in the area today.The cave now seems like just a large crack in the rock above the Cumberland, but it is actually protected as a national landmark and the entrance is guarded by steel bars.
