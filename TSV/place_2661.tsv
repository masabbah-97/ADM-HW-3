In 1929, the nickelodeon was renamed the ‘Roxy’ and showed some of the country’s finest ‘talkies,’ film shorts that featured the first synchronized sound. The theatre was once again renamed the ‘Majestic Bay’ and continued showing films until 1997.The Majestic Bay Theatre is furnished with retro ornamentation, reminiscent of its classic theatre decorations; bright neon lights welcome moviegoers to an old-style box office; a beautiful waterfall curtain rises to begin the show; nautical adornment reflects the Pacific Northwest and Seattle’s maritime culture.Though it no longer shows the ‘talkies’ of yesteryear, the Majestic Bay Theatre immerses the moviegoer in a timeless ambiance.	Continuing a tradition of movie magic on the site of America’s oldest continually operating movie theatre.
