After lying dormant for the better part of the 20th century, the cave was put into service by Clemson University as a blue cheese growing habitat thanks to the cave’s stable 50 degree temperature.Currently the almost 1,700 feet of unused tunnel is maintained as a public park and visitors are welcome to explore the shallow mountain incursion, however there are bats living in the cave which may send explorers running from the site just like the rail workers of yore. 	An unfinished rail tunnel that has since been used to house cheese and bats.
