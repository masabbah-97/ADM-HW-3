Despite being the birthplace of one of the most enduring figures in American history, even at the time, the home was demolished to make way for retail space in 1916. After his death in 1919, this grave mistake was rectified by a women’s group who set to work rebuilding and recreating Roosevelt’s childhood home in its entirety. Using a neighboring building as an architectural template as well as furniture and design advice from Roosevelt’s widow, the group was able to restore the site to the same comfortable state it was in in 1865.The birthplace still operates today as a living museum that highlights and honors the president’s roots and career. Among the artifacts on display from Roosevelt’s adventurous life is the shirt he was wearing when shot by a would-be assassin in 1912. The once blood-stained shirt, which was washed before it was installed in the museum, is now a lily-white blouse that still shows the hole where the bullet penetrated the president’s chest. Luckily, the projectile was slowed by a steel eyeglass case and a thick, folded speech inside Roosevelt’s jacket pocket. Being one of the manliest men ever to walk the Earth, Roosevelt shrugged off the flesh wound and went on to deliver the speech, despite the huge bullet hole straight through the pages. The life-saving piece of rhetoric is also on display.Despite bullets and wrecking crews, Teddy Roosevelt’s legacy lives on thanks to the very place where it started.             	The rough and tumble president's childhood home displays the shirt he was once shot in and the speech that saved him.
