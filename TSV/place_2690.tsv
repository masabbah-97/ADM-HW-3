In fact, it is something considerably more fun.Behind the seemingly normal facade lies a hidden bar. Inside you’ll find a mysterious phone, and one washing machine that’s a bit more door-like than machine-like.Visitors hoping to stop in for a drink need to call ahead to book a washing machine, and when arriving, hit the button on that mystery phone, and let the voice on the other end know you’re here to do a load. The rest will take care of itself.	This Manchester laundromat is hiding something.
