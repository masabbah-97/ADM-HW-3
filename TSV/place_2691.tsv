0	Old Man of Hoy	rock formations,geological oddities,geology	235	825	The Old Man of Hoy isn’t actually a man at all, or a human being for that matter. It’s a red sandstone monolith nearly 450 feet high, rising out of the sea in northern Scotland, and part of the Orkney archipelago.The monolith is a journey to get to and popular with climbers. If you choose to not visit on foot, you may catch a glimpse of the towering stone sea stack from a boat or the ferry running from the mainland to Orkney. The Rackwick Bay and cliffs in the area are worth the visit alone.	A red sandstone freestanding monolith rises out of the sea in northern Scotland.
