It was built a bit off the beaten path to take advantage of the veins of ore in the nearby Deep River. Refined iron only steamed from the Endor Iron Furnace for a cumulative total of ten years, but its remains have kept the memory of a tumultuous time alive for well over a hundred years.Update as of August 2020: The site is currently fenced off for protection. 	Ruins of an American Civil War iron forge still survive today.
