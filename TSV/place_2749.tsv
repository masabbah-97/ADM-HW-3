It was installed on October 6, 1985, after being floated up the Willamette River on a barge.When it was installed, it was taken through the city streets, and a layer of copper was rubbed off of Portlandia’s finger as people reached up to touch the statue on its way to its final destination.The statue is based on the design of the city seal.
