The building retained many of the original Art Deco features including the ornate ceilings, chandeliers, and a large stained glass wall, which is currently behind the counter.It is unclear if the staircases are original, but they have been constructed to complement the style of the interiors. Outside is the massive eagle which was the symbol of the old Imperial.People often visit to snap pictures of the unlikely but amazing synthesis.	This restored Portuguese cafe may well be the most beautiful place in the world to grab a Big Mac.
