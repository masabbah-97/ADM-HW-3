Mac-O-Chee castle is older, larger, and in slightly more disrepair than the other, but in their day both of the homes were unusually gorgeous examples of old world architecture. Each of the buildings was decked out in rich, intricate woodwork, painted ceilings and even indoor water closets, a luxurious innovation at the time.Once the original owners passed away, their eccentric homes and the collection of artifacts within were opened as small museums, a state in which they are maintained and preserved today. The Piatt castles are still open for tours and are now a popular location for weddings and events, despite the original 1800s bathrooms.   	This pair of eccentric Ohio castles were built by a pair of brothers who wanted to bring a bit of class to the Ohio wilderness.
