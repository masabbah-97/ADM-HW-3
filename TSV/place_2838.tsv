And it is all owned by Swarovski. Swarovski’s surreal museum/theme park Crystal Worlds was first opened back in 1995 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company’s founding. Like something out of a fairy tale, the park’s main attraction is the “Chambers of Wonder” exhibition, which is contained within a green hill, the entrance of which is made to look like a crouching giant. The exhibition itself consists of over a dozen different rooms decked out in Swarovski crystals, creating uniquely themed, glittering spaces that could just as easily be a dwarf king’s treasure hall.In 2015, the park was given a facelift and expanded to almost double the original size. Now it also features a large, outdoor green space with attractions throughout, including a playground tower for children and a “Crystal Cloud” made up of over 800,000 separate gems. There is even a hedge maze shaped like a giant hand.Whether or not you could actually afford anything studded with actual Swarovski crystals, Crystal Worlds is an incredible sight for anyone with a love of fantasy.
