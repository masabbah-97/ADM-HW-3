It wouldn’t be until 1998 that their prestigious history would be cataloged in their own museum. The museum documents the evolution of the NYPD from the rattler wearing Dutch enforcers to today’s modern police officers. Unfortunately, due to hurricane Sandy, the museum is currently closed while it is being repaired. 	Hear the tales of New York's most notorious criminals.	77 Water Street,The Elevated Acre,Site of New York Slave Market	100 Old Slip,New York, New York, 10005,United States	40.7036	-74.0084	Oliver Hong	 	2012-03-20	 	Museo de Ropa Étnica de México (Mexican Ethnic Clothing Museum),War Museum Askifou,Caballero No. 1,Jacobsen Museum	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-city-police-museum
