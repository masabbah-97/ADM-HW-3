The home was so secluded that Knapp had to build a new road just to have the place built. However the rich digs would not last long. In 1940, only five weeks after Knapp had sold the posh grounds a forest fire raged through the grounds, utterly destroying all but the stone skeleton of the structure.The land remains under private ownership, although the site has been landmarked by the county, preventing any restoration or development on the site. The remnants of the stone frame still sit at the top of the hill, attracting hikers and photographers looking for a magical backdrop and maybe hoping that some of Knapp’s luck will rub off on them. Update as of June 2020: The site is closed to visitors and is under new construction.  	The ruins of the castle that chemicals built.
