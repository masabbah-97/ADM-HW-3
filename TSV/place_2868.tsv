This vintage throwback takes advantage of the area’s strangely stacked natural rock formations. The titular Pivot Rock looks like an upside-down pyramid, right down to the stepped ridges on its edges. Other geological oddities on the grounds include the Natural Bridge, which looks just like it sounds, a naturally occurring stone bridge.According to local Ozark legend, the park was home to the Jesse James gang of outlaws for a time. However, it’s true that most every place in the area claims this, so the claim to fame may be drummed up to help attract visitors. Either way, there aren’t too many of these classic roadside tourist traps left along the American byways, so stop by Pivot Rock Park to help support a century-long tradition of road trip culture. 	This century-old roadside attraction is full of bizarre rock formations.
