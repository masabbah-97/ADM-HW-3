Founder of the Bellaire Historical Society and Toy Museum, home of the World’s Largest LEGO brick image, Brown claims to have the largest private LEGO collection in the world.Located in Bellaire, Ohio, the massive LEGO exhibit started out as a simple toy museum. Intending on providing a LEGO room devoted to the popular toy, his favoritism won out, and each room became LEGO themed, with those “other” toys here and there to compliment the LEGO bricks displayed. Rooms portray the ocean, a zoo, an old-west town, a classroom complete with a life-sized teacher, and other astonishingly large pieces such as a life-sized astronaut.Not surprisingly, Brown has a special place in his heart for Star Wars as well, and the galaxy is represented in a breathtaking exhibit featuring light effects. Using engineering, animatronics, and over 4 million LEGO pieces, Dan Brown shows the kids how it’s done.	Unofficial lego museum with over four million bricks.
