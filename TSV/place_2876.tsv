The exhaustive hike up the hill follows an old path of carved stone stairs, dotted with small wooden huts. The entire path is guided by the portal at the peak, but the views on the way up make it obvious why generations of people in Hunan believed that Tianmen Shan was the realm of the gods.	999 stairs lead visitors through a massive hole in a mountain known as the Gateway to Heaven.
