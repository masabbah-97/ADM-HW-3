There are exhibits that cycle through but many are permanent installations.A statement from the museum website explains it as so: “The MEAM is the new temple of this new religion. The religion of those who believe, in the XXI century, in Art. An Art that is not content with experimentation turned into an end in itself, or the permanent trial without reaching any definite forms, or the cult of noise by noise, or with video montages burdened by boredom. In short, an art that justifies itself as something direct, explicit, categorical, absolute, real, intelligible and brilliant.”	A temple to modernity, tucked away amid Barcelona's more well known museums.
