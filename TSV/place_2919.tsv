Both creepy and beautiful, they feature small grates scattered along the upper floor of the cathedral through which, while you are touring, you may look down at any given moment to see the artistically arranged dead illuminated.	The mortal remains of an estimated 70,000 people lie in the basement of a monastery in Lima, Peru.
