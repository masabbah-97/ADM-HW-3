He drank a six pack a day and saved all the cans.When he retired in the 1960s, he put the cans to good use by covering the exterior of his house with them. Not wanting any part of the cans to go to waste, Milkovisch built mobiles, fences, sculptures and windmills out of the tops and bottoms of his beer cans, as well as wind chimes and curtains out of the pull tabs.When John died in 1988, he had spent 18 years covering his house, fence and even his tree with some 39,000 beer cans. In the words of John Milkovisch: “Some people say this is sculpture, but I didn’t go to no expensive school to get these crazy notions.” 	Beer lover's can-covered house.
