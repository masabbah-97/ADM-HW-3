Visitors can ascend the winding stair that wraps itself around the tower and look out upon the ethereal and heavily wooded terrain just right outside the city.In 1889, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I and to showcase the commercial and industrial innovation of the region, the tower began construction. The tower was first made of wood, however, and was destroyed by a storm shortly after its grand reveal. A year later, the tower reopened––this time made of steel––but by WWII, it began to decay and was demolished in 1953. A few years later, another attempt to reconstruct the tower began and it has remained ever since, with the last extensive renovation in the early 80s.Near the tower is a small museum dedicated to the education and preservation of the local ecology of the region and is often utilized by school groups and tourists alike.	Located right outside of Vienna, visitors can take in expansive views of an ethereal forest.
