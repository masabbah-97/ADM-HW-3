In 1989, an artistically driven nonprofit called the Luggage Store Gallery annexed the adjacent alley, which the city ended up leasing to the group for $1 per year. Soon the area was transformed, bringing a speck of nature and art to what was long one of the San Francisco’s most notorious neighborhoods. Today the alley walls are covered in neighborhood art and shaded by four-story-high redwoods, among a variety of other plants.
