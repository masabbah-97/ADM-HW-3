0	Elf Door at Demings Height Park	follies and grottoes	245	781	If you take a stroll through Deming Heights Park, keep your eyes peeled for the infamous elf door, a mysterious little handmade door set at the base of an old tree.The door is clearly well maintained, its wood polished, its hinges freshly oiled, and weeds and debris regularly cleared from its doorstep. Rumor has it, that the magical elf who lives inside the tree leaves treasures and twinkly trinkets inside the door for local children to find, but feel free to leave your own personalized keepsake for prosperity’s sake.While you’re at Deming Park, take a stroll to the top of Norwegian Hill, known as the highest point in Minneapolis.
