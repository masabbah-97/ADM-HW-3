Wynia has created near 1000 pieces of welded wildlife that he refers to as archeological finds from the area’s lost “Iron Age” (get it?). The collection includes towering metal works such as a handful of enormous rusted dragons, moderately large pieces such as the hobbits outside his wife’s art studio, and small works such as iron snails that could fit in the palm of a hand. Each and every piece has a name and story to go along with it such as Oxide the Watchdog, Porky-Pine the Half-Pig-Half-Porcupine, and Abe Lawbender the lawyer from Shysterville. Equal parts sculpture garden and charlatan’s paradise, the park offers a unique vision of the past as one man would have liked it.  	"""Iron Age"" creatures fill this huckster's rusted metal sculpture garden."	45 X 90 Geographical Marker,World's Fair Wisconsin Pavilion,Chatty Belle	112021 Old Sugarbush Lane,Marshfield, Wisconsin, 54449,United States	44.7358	-90.1673	KG	 	2012-11-01	 	Tim Willis' Junkyard Playground,Franz Sederevičiaus Sculpture Ensemble,Mechanical Riverfront Kingdom on Druid Hill,Rattlesnake Ranch	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jurustic-park
