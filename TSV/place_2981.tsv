A consistent churn of over 22 million gallons of water a day flows through the pool, meaning it needs no chlorination. The popular stop at Balmorhea State Park was part of the New Deal, FDR’s Depression-era plan to create jobs. The CCC operated from 1933 to 1942, creating manual labor for unskilled, unemployed men and preserving and developing the country’s natural resources.	A spring-fed pool so deep it's used for scuba diving as well as swimming.
