Its looming ferris wheel has become an unsettling icon of the nuclear disaster, and visitors sometimes leave stuffed animals in its cars as a memorial. The park still contains varying levels of radiation, although the concrete areas are mostly safe. The area under the ferris wheel has some of the highest levels of radiation in the amusement park.There is also an abandoned bumper-car ride, with most rides still fully intact.Â 	This attraction was abandoned after the Chernobyl disaster.
