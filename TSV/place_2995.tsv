Out of the center drawer hangs a mismatched pair of neon-colored socks, each six feet long (supposedly a shout-out to the town’s hosiery industry).At nearly 40 feet tall, the colossal chest is roughly the size of a large house or small building, which in fact is precisely what it is. The bureau is actually the facade of an office space that’s currently up for sale. For the price of $235,000, you could own what’s been dubbed the World’s Largest Chest of Drawers. For everyone else, it’s worth driving by and stopping for a peek; the jumbo dresser is certainly a high point of the town.	A six-foot pair of socks hangs from a drawer of the world's largest bureau.
