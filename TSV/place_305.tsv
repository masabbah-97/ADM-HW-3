However, its most striking grave marker may be the unsettling statue known as Haserot’s Angel.Actually named “The Angel of Death Victorious,” the stoic angel is seated on the marble gravestone of canning entrepreneur Francis Haserot and his family. The life-size bronze holds an extinguished torch upside-down, a symbol of life extinguished. Her wings are outstretched and she gazes straight ahead.The statue’s most striking feature, however, is how death’s guardian appears to be weeping black tears, which pour from her eyes and drip down her neck.These “tears” formed over time, an effect of the aging bronze combined with the impressive sculpting work of the piece itself.  As a result, she is often referred to as the Weeping Angel.Although Lake View Cemetery stretches over 280 acres, many visitors take the time to go searching for this melancholy sentinel. Even though she is undeniably unnerving, she is also undeniably beautiful. 	The angel of death appears to weep black tears at this grave marker.	Wade Memorial Chapel,Grave of Alan Freed,James A.
