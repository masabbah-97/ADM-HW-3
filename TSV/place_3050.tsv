There are 56 stumps that have been visible in 1940, 1958, 1962, 1978, 2007, and most recently in 2010 after a severe storm. Counting the rings on the stumps revealed they were over 100 years old.The Drowned Forest off Odiorne Point is in shallower water and is accessible during low tide. 	Stumps of an Ice Age forest, visible only at low tide.
