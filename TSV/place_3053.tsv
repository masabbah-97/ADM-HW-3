The giant statue is built from a metal frame covered in colorful fiberglass, and is built to withstand hurricane force winds. The statue claims to be the largest Paul Bunyan statue in the world. As in many cases of “world’s largest” things, it may be true, but verifying such a fact is a bit tough.Regardless, it may also be the most handsome Bunyan in existence. In America, giant Paul Bunyan statues can be found all across the roadways, but many are fairly crudely sculpted roadside muffler men. However the Bangor Bunyan is a notably detailed and jolly sculpt.Paul Bunyan’s legend is a staple of American culture as a whole, but the Bangor Bunyan joined the larger cultural landscape when it came to life in Stephen King’s novel It. The beloved statue has also taken part in a number of local promotional events that see the figure don other clothes such as a Shriner’s fez. In 2015 the original designer of the statue suggested that they add a giant ox to the site.  	This handsome giant is said to mark the birthplace of the mythical woodsman and even had a cameo in a Stephen King novel.
