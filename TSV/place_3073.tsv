0	Secret Swing	outsider art	122	767	In 2003, artist Corwyn Lund erected a playground swing off of the infamous Graffiti Alley of Toronto, Ontario. As the location of the swing became more widespread on the internet, it evolved into a bit of a cult icon among street artists and Toronto youth.In November 2005, the swing was removed by unknown individuals, but was soon replaced on December 13, 2005, with the names “Vince and Kai” signed on it. However, in March 2006 the swing was permanently destroyed and the site was blocked with a metal gate, supposedly to deter homeless people from sleeping in the alleyway.Although one can no longer see or ride the swing, the site can still be visited, though the alleyway now looks sad and empty like it is missing something. Perhaps the installation of a playground slide is in order? One can always hope.	Secret Swing.
