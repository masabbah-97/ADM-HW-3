Visitors are guided through exhibits that explore the importance of magic and mysticism throughout the ages, many of which focus on specific cultures and regions.Around 450 exhibits populate the museum. They range from ritualistic African masks to torture devices made famous across medieval Europe. The museum also features the imaginary study of alchemist Nicolas Flamel and artifacts from witch trials that took place across the Netherlands. The Magicum is also heralded as one of the only interactive magic museums, with exhibits that allow visitors to engage in riddles and a bit of magical wonder. When visitors receive their tickets, they are also provided with a flyer. On the flyer, they can scribble answers to several of the museum’s interactive games and challenges. Magic shows are often held on the weekends, making the museum the perfect afternoon stop for a family outing. 	Visitors can explore the role of mysticism throughout the ages inside this interactive museum of magic.
