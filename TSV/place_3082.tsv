This lush oasis features well over 2,000 varieties of orchids, from Aerangis articulata, to a wide range of Staghorn ferns. Many of which visitors may have never seen before.Orchid Trail Greenhouses was created by John Stanton, who had a deep passion for hybrids of the plant. Stroll through the two sale houses to see if any particular plant piques your fancy. There is also a private collection viewing house, which is said to be one of the largest private collections in the whole state. Be sure to dress light and bring water as it remains humid inside for the plants. 	Wander through more than 20,000 square feet filled with an amazing collection of orchids.
