Reported sightings in the area continued until the collapse of the Silver Bridge in December of 1967.The Mothman and the circumstances around its mysterious appearance in Point Pleasant would later be chronicled in John Keel’s 1976 book The Mothman Prophecies and its 2002 movie adaptation.While there seems to be no established theory explaining the mass sightings, nor a theory as to why the creature would choose the TNT Area as its home, the rows of World War II-era igloo-like bunkers and dilapidated laboratories give it all the ambiance a discerning monster could want. The TNT Area became a Superfund site in 1983 and is still undergoing cleanup and decontamination.	These rows of World War II-era bunkers were the scene of some of the infamous Mothman sightings.
