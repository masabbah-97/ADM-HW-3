The ancient arbors originally grew 325 million years ago in the area and thanks to the extreme rarity of preserved prehistoric flora, the innocuous group of stony stumps is a major research site. In fact the building that surrounds the fossilized remains is classified as a museum.	Hidden in a Scotland museum is a copse of extinct tree stumps.
