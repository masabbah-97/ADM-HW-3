Since a different architect created each of the five rooms, their styles differ wildly. There is a bird’s nest, an elevated cabin, a red shack called the Blue Cone, a flying saucer, and the Mirrorcube.Mirrorcube has come to be the most well known room, covered on all six sides with mirrors that reflect the forest. As a symbol of the guiding environmental principles, visitors staying in Mirrorcube melt into the landscape while enjoying the ultra-modern and minimalist interior. Besides the five rooms, the Treehotel also features a sauna, and has plans to expand to a total of 24 rooms.	A series of modernist treehouse hotel rooms grace the outskirts of an Arctic forest.
