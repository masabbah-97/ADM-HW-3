It’s broken up into three different installations of Chihuly’s work.At the center, two turquoise crystalline towers rise 40 feet tall, and glow blue when illuminated at night. The Seaform Pavilion is covered by a ceiling decorated with over 2,000 glass pieces resembling an array marine life, giving the impression you are walking underneath the ocean. The third installation, the Venetian Wall, is an 80-foot-long wall displaying 109 Art Deco-esque glass vase sculptures.	A beautiful footbridge with over 2,000 glass sculptures along the walls and ceiling.
