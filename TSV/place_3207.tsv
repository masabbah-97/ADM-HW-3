The golden dome at one end can be seen from miles up the road like a sunrise on the horizon. This seasonal, family-owned business has been operating here nearly 40 years. From mid-May to November, visitors can find local, regional, and imported sweets and treats of all kinds: candied fruits, chocolate bars, fresh baked goods, frozen items, gummies, jelly beans, sodas of every flavor (including Moxie, Cheerwine, and Faygo’s Rock N’ Rye), and even a few toys.While you shop, you can also admire the ceilings painted in a wild, whimsical dreamscape of food and pop culture impressions. Don’t forget to read the oversized billboard on the way out of the gravel parking lot: It’s usually posted with some quippy pun or sarcastic reflection on the times.	This bright yellow building is packed with sweet treats from all around the world, from chocolate-covered crickets to whoopie pies.
