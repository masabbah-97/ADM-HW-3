The organ’s music is eerily reminiscent of the melancholy sound of whale calls.The Sea Organ was designed by architect Nikola Bašić and completed in 2005. Just behind it is another art installation he created — the Sun Salutation — which has an ethereal pattern of glass panels that capture sunlight to power their own light show that is a tribute to the solar system. 	A musical instrument played by the sea.
