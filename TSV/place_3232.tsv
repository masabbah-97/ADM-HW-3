The river gets its coloration from a mixture of sulfur and calcium carbonate which are seeded into the water from the nearby volcano. Along the river there are multiple hot springs and an impressive waterfall, all the same, seemingly unnatural blue. Pictures of the waters are regularly accused of being photoshopped or invented, but the simple chemistry in the river’s depths is very real, as countless hikers experience each year.  	This neon blue river gets its color from a unique mix of bacteria and volcano minerals.
