Zee plane!” at the “lagoon” and iconic house as your background - a photo op that many find hard to resist. A quick walk down the hill and you are strolling through geometric herb gardens as peacock fashionistas glare and slowly scatter in your wake. The Arboretum is a popular filming location due to its ability to stand in as several exotic climates including Greece, Japan, South America, and Australia while being a mere 20 miles outside of Hollywood. The location is also popular with succulent and native plant lovers, who converge for the annual InterCity Cactus and Succulent Show, hosted by the Arboretum and organized by three local cactus and succulent societies. 	Arcadia is home to a haven for nature geeks and 80s TV lovers alike.
