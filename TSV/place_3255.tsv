Much of the development that goes on around the home is met with resistance from the community, but so far nothing has been stopped and no plans have yet surfaced to destroy the Lamp house either.  The house has hallmarks of Wright’s Prairie School style, and is recognizable as something different among the other surrounding buildings. In fact the floor plan was essentially a dry run for Wright’s famous guide to building, A Fireproof House for $5000. While the angular design of the home is rather indelible, the condition of the house is less than perfect, as one might expect from a home without a tenant. However even despite the sad condition of the estate, it remains an important if largely unknown bit of architectural history. 	Hidden away in the city of Madison, Wisconsin is a nearly forgotten home that Frank Lloyd Wright built for a childhood friend.
