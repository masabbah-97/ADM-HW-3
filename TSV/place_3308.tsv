Factory Butte, a cathedral-like sandstone hill that rises above the rugged Caineville badlands, is one of these lesser-known gems. Part of an ensemble of small, flat-topped mesas called the Upper Blue Hills, Factory Butte culminates at 6,302 feet. With its root-like combs, crags, and shoulders that snake towards the hilltop, it seems deeply entrenched in the ground, like a very old rock stump. The surrounding, barren landscape is equally otherworldly; it feels as though you’re exploring another planet, and for good reason: If you go, you’re likely to be the only one there.When exploring this colorful formation, don’t forget your camera. While the scenery is striking on an overcast afternoon, it’ll surely be even more surreal at sunset. 	A striking, menacing sandstone peak towering above a landscape that's equal parts Mordor and the Moon.
