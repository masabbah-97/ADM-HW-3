This confrontation led to the arrest of Adolf Hitler for treason and garnered the future leader his first bit of national attention which would eventually lead to his rise in power. Once the Nazi party did finally become the political driver in Germany, Hitler declared the site a national landmark, requiring that passersby perform the Hitlergruß (Nazi salute). Officers were stationed at the site to ensure this happened. However, not everyone supported Hitler or the Nazi party and as an act of passive resistance, these opposers would take an alternate route around the monument using the Viscardigasse alley. Originally named after a famed Swiss architect, the narrow road soon became known among the locals as the “Drueckebergergasse,” roughly translated as “Shirker’s Alley” or “Deserter’s Alley.”Today the little alley is a pedestrian-only walkway with a meandering trail of bronzed paving bricks commemorating the brave Germans who refused to give Hitler even the satisfaction of a salute. Update December 2017: The previous construction work has been completed and the bricks restored. 	Golden cobblestones remember a time when this small alley was used to avoid having to give a Nazi salute.
