Its changing patterns are meant to reflect the “never-ending rhythm of the surrounding domestic, financial and commercial activities.” The initial idea was to make the London Stock Exchange’s activities trigger the lights, but it was scrapped as it cost too much to put into practice.The tall “Traffic Light Tree” changes its 75 sets of lights in a random order, much to the confusion of unprepared drivers. Indeed, when Saga Motor Insurance surveyed British motorists on the best and worst roundabouts in the country in 2005, the one containing the “Tree” naturally came up high on the ranking.	A student driver's nightmare.
