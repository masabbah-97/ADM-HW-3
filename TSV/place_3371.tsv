Visitors can climb to the top of the mound via a concrete staircase.The mound tomb was constructed approximately 2500 years ago as one of many similar mound earthworks. Excavations in 1869 revealed a bark-covered skeleton and a chamber located 28 feet deep into the mound, but the chamber was found to be empty.The Adena people flourished between 1000-200 BC and established their homes across what is now Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and New York. There are several burial mounds and an estimated 200 other Adena-related sites scattered throughout their territory.The Miamisburg Mound is in a local park and is a designated Ohio Historical Site.	The largest ancient burial mound in Ohio.
