The natural bridge is the symbol for the region, whose mountainous peaks and beautiful forests have earned it the nickname Bohemian, or Czech, Switzerland.The rock outcropping is made all the more wondrous by the picturesque chateau built right into the rock face, dubbed the Sokolí hnízdo, or “Falcon’s Nest.” It was built in 1881 from a previous inn by the powerful Austro-Hungarian Clary-Aldringen family to house important guests. While princes or dignitaries no longer stay at the chateau, it has been preserved as a period restaurant and a museum dedicated to the history of the park.	Europe's largest natural bridge has a 19th century royal chateau built into its side.
