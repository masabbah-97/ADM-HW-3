Staff involved in redwood conservation say they’ve never seen redwoods twisted in this fashion anywhere else.While their unique shapes make them beautiful to behold, it is thought that this is also what enabled them to survive the logging that carried off so much of California’s old-growth redwoods; they were too twisted to be of much use to the lumber mills.
