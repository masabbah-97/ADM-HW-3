In some of the bookcases, there are bullet holes from the Easter Rising, when the hotel next door was occupied. A unique feature that still stands is the three wired alcoves, or “cages,” which were created in the late 18th century in response to thefts at the library. Readers would have to be locked inside to peruse the rarest books.	The oldest public library in Ireland.
