Here you may see jars crammed full of moles or bats, bisected chimpanzee and sea lion heads, kangaroo and manatee fetuses, pickled tree shrews, lion skeletons, and Tapir skulls.   There are specimens from Robert Grant himself, along with Thomas Henry Huxley, bisected heads from the collection of Sir Victor Negus, and glass models made in the 1800s by the Blaschka family.In 2013, the Grant Museum opened the Micrarium in a formerly unused office space. It’s a backlit cavern of microscopic and lantern slides celebrating the tiniest creatures in the world.	The only university zoological museum in London houses extinct animals, bizarre natural history specimens, and a Micrarium of microscopic creatures.
