Founded by Atlanta rapper and actor T.I., one of trap music’s forefathers, the museum showcases his recreated closet, featuring clothes, assault rifles, and his 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance, which helped catapult him and trap music to international acclaim.Visitors to the museum typically wait outside in a lengthy line before entering through a recreated corner store, which highlights the central role these cheap convenience stores played in poverty-stricken neighborhoods as distribution sites for drug dealers and as the epicenter for trap culture.Naturally, trap music plays as you explore the museum, which also houses a full bar, an add-on escape room, the pink Chevy from artist 2 Chainz’s infamous “Pink Trap House,” and an opportunity to pose with Jeezy’s cocaine snowman while holding prop bricks of cocaine.	A provocative museum dedicated to the genre and the harsh realities that inspired its origins.	Robert C.
