It leads to a secret spring bubbling with life, tucked out of sight along the most famous road in the United States.A man named Shaffer created this hidden roadside wonder in the 1930s under the Works Progress Administration. While constructing the “Gold Road Section” that weaves between Gold Road Mine and Kingman, Arizona, he noticed water cascading down the cliff walls. To take advantage of the precious resource, he built a basin of stones at its base to allow the water to pool.This minute, secluded oasis soon became a welcome refuge for the weary travelers and parched animals passing through. Because the water stems from a consistent natural source, the bowl remains full year-round. Locals frequently keep it stocked with goldfish (leading some to call it the “fish bowl spring”), and the snails clinging to its walls help keep the algae at bay so the water stays fresh.Desert-dwelling animals like bees and burros still frequent the site to quench their thirsts. Humans, however, are less common. Only travelers who already know of its existence or those who happen to spot the stairs will ever stumble upon this secret spring.	A secret fresh water spring for animals and humans alike hidden along the most famous road in the United States.
