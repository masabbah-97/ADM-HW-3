Sculptor Miguel Ángel Ruiz Beato’s “Air Crash” takes the falling part quite literally.The sculpture of an angel mid-crash isn’t meant to depict Lucifer though, just a winged man who, according to Beato, went for a long walk and flew home with his back to the ground, sunbathing. While he was gone a city had been erected on the bare meadow where he usually landed.The bronze angel crash-landed in January 2005. Most locals and tourists are unaware of Beato’s narrative for the 600-pound angel. There are, however, a few prevailing theories of just who it’s supposed to be: Lucifer, Icarus, or even Led Zeppelin’s Swan Song Angel.	A whimsical brother of the nearby Fallen Angel statue takes the falling part quite literally.
