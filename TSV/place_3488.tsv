It’s known for showing offbeat, underseen gems and hosting events including live scores featuring local groups, mass hypnosis, interactive theater, and slideshows with tiki accompaniments. The polar opposite of a chain theater, this no-frills cinephile haven is BYO-snacks and beverages. Midnights are a specialty, though they’re open seven days a week year-round.
