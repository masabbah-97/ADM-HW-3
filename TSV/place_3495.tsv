To reach the isolated shores, the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge was built, albeit crudely at first. The span, which crosses a mere 66 foot gap, is suspended almost 100 feet above the crashing waves and rocks below and has existed in some form for over 350 years. As recently as the 1970s the bridge was little more than a series of precarious wooden slats strung across the chasm with no more than a single guide rope to hold on to.Due to the continued fishing off the shore of the island, the salmon population no longer yields enough to make such hunting worthwhile, but the bridge remains. Today it is supported by steel wires and rope, and the wooden path across the bridge is no longer quite as dangerous as it once was. It is mainly used by tourists or visitors wishing to take in the stunning view of the surrounding nature from the small island, but that does not mean that the rope bridge is any less frightening to cross. There are often people who will themselves across the swaying expanse once, but are then too scared to take it back across, having to be ferried from Carrickarede by boat.    	This short bridge is the only thing connecting a tiny Irish island to the mainland.
