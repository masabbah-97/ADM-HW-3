The skills of the clockmaker, musician, sculptor, painter, and dressmaker can all be used in an automaton restoration project.A visit to the appointment-only House of Automata will give you an insight into the anatomy of mechanical life, from a sailing ship the size of a fingernail to the glamorous Nancy, a larger than life breathing automaton. 	A curious collection of mechanical moving figures.
