I always thought I’d like my own tombstone to be blank. No epitaph and no name.Well, actually, I’d like it to say “figment.”The famous artist is buried in St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery near the western Pennsylvania towns of Bethel Park and Castle Shannon. His grave is now the target of two cameras that feed their images to a page on the Andy Warhol Museum’s website — a project called “Figment.”Fans are known to bring cans of Campbell’s Soup and other bits of pop culture ephemera to the gravesite.	The pop art icon's gravesite is broadcast 24 hours a day on his museum's website.
