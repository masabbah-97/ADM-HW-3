The planets, all appropriately scaled, are all around Stockholm and its suburbs. Jupiter (diameter 7.3 m) is at the Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport, Saturn is in Uppsala, and Pluto in Delsbo, 300 km from the Globe Arena. At each planet, a small exhibit provides information about astronomy and the mythological figure after whom each planet is named.Even a few non-planets are represented in the Swedish solar system. Sedna, a trans-Neptunian object, can be found 912 km from the Globe Arena in the “Technical House” in Luleå.	The world's largest model of our planetary system.
