Umbrella Alley derived from an initiative to beautify the historic Texas Avenue area in Baytown. Down this short alley, over 120 multicolored umbrellas float overhead, casting dancing shadows on the ground and alley walls. Umbrellas of every color create a wonderful, whimsical feel when venturing down the alley. The umbrella installation was created by the Baytown Tourism Team and the mural art was done by the Lee College Art Department. It displays the unique ecology of the Baytown area.	Tucked away down this Baytown alley exists a one-of-a-kind art exhibit of technicolor umbrellas.	1940 Air Terminal Museum,The Orange Show,Smither Park	124 W Texas Ave,Baytown, Texas, 77520,United States	29.7328	-94.9692	skcrutcher	narlenevans93,sjgranai,visitbaytown,jbot,michaelpsauerwein,thegenxjourney	2019-11-02	30 Places to Go Deep in the Art of Texas	St Catherine's Passage,Bob Gasoi Memorial Art Alley,Callejon de Hamel,It's A Burl	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/umbrella-alley
