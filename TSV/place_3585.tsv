0	Cave Vineyard	caves,ecosystems	84	689	Missouri is known as the cave state, so it’s no surprise that in the heart of the Ozark countryside you’d find the Cave Vinyard. Owned and operated by the Strussione family, this winery takes terroir to new levels.At the end of an enchanting drive through rolling farmlands, old-fashioned barns, and antique signs, you’ll arrive at the winery. All overlooking a small lake surrounded by the Ozark hills. Pick up some wine, cheese, handmade biscottis (an in-house specialty), and journey towards the entrance of Saltpeter Cave.At the end of a short, winding path, you’ll come face-to-face with the mouth of the cave. It extends deep underground and is filled with chairs, tables, and old oak barrels. A bubbling spring runs through the cave, while a cool-mist creates a mysterious mood. Adding to this enchanting experience is the echoing laughter and chatter from other guests—all the makings of a flight you won’t soon forget.	A subterranean haunt where wine and homemade biscottis are always on the menu.	Liberty Bell of the West,Popeye Character Trail,Castor River Shut-Ins	21124 Cave Rd,Ste.
