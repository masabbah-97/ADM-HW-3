Today, that building still stands, but now it is home to a decidedly less magical 7-Eleven convenience store. For years, all trace of the event that created a entire brand of fun occult devices had been wiped away and all but forgotten, save for the efforts of Ouija history superhero, Robert Murch, founder of The Talking Board Historical Society.  In 2015, Murch and the Talking Board Historical Society worked with the city of Baltimore and got authorization to install a plaque in the 7-Eleven that remembered and told the story of Ouija history on the spot. They originally planned to install the plaque during a Ouija convention, but the unfortunate riots that took place in the city that year saw the 7-Eleven ransacked. Undaunted, once the convenience store was put back in order, Murch was finally able to have the plaque installed.Today you can visit the 7-Eleven and see the historic plaque describing the events of that fateful night that changed the game of popular occultism.

This simple convenience store sits on the location where the Ouija board was named—and has a plaque to prove it.
