She donated them to avoid their seizure by the Italian government.Â There were rumors that the bones of the martyr were actually the bones of a policeman who was shot defending the church from burglars but the parish denies this.The relic chapel also features small relics from over 150 other saints.	Relics given to a Manhattan church to avoid seizure by the Italian government.
