0	Healer	venues,music,art	130	684	The Healer was once an office building where people came to toil away under the pressures of corporate America. Now the building is an art and music venue, where people come to have their souls replenished and fulfilled.All that remains of this building’s former life are the office cubicles that now house various art installations. Each installation is an immersive and unique experience that adds to the greater theme of the venue. During the weekends, live music shows showcase touring acts and local Indianapolis musicians. It’s also one of the only all-ages venues in Indy that also has a bar for those looking for libations.The Healer is tucked behind an AutoZone and next to a trucking academy with an inconspicuous exterior. However, once visitors step inside the Healer, they are immediately transported out of Indianapolis and into a magical realm of sound and colors. It’s truly unlike anything else in the city. 	This former office building has been transformed into an immersive music venue and art space.
