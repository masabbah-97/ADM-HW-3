His stickwork creations were made with the help of some 200 volunteers who scavenged invasive species such as ligustrum, Roosevelt willow, and ash from around the city. Over 10 tons of saplings were brought in to build the five structures. Commissioned by the Pease Park Conservancy, the site-specific installation was inspired by the surroundings, the city, and the people of Austin. The natural structures are expected to last about two years; when they begin to deteriorate, the remains will be taken down and used as mulch throughout the park.	An exquisite grouping of structures made from 10 tons of invasive saplings.
