But to truly experience what makes this 18th-century church special, visitors must venture down the stairs and elevator to the crypt. There, beneath the brick-vaulted ceiling and spread across the grave-lined floor, they’ll find a café. Café in the Crypt certainly wasn’t what the builders had in mind when they constructed St. Martin’s in 1726. But since most of the crypt’s bodies were removed in the 1800s, the space has been repurposed as a restaurant. Now the subterranean spot is the perfect place for travelers to grab coffee, tea, and pastries after exploring Trafalgar Square. As they sip their lattes, visitors can look at the historic statues and graves that still line the cool, cavernous room. In addition to the café, the space also now houses a gallery and a gift shop, and frequently hosts jazz concerts. 	This coffee shop lies hidden beneath a historic church.
