0	Zoom Flume	waterparks,graffiti,outsider art,abandoned	186	682	The Zoom Flume operated during the summer months from the late 1970s to the early 1980s in Bloomington, Indiana, right near Lake Monroe.It’s not well documented why the attraction closed, but it was likely due to insurance and safety concerns. Now it sits abandoned in the woods right off of State Road 446 and is covered in colorful graffiti. The lot is for sale and there is a small fence around the slide, however, it’s still visible and makes for an interesting artspace. 	Tucked away in the forests of Indiana resides an abandoned waterslide that is now a popular graffiti haunt.
