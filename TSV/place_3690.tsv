One observer of 1960s San Francisco culture noted, “To this hill streamed the endless river of young persons drawn to San Francisco in search of personal freedom, in search of peace in time of war, or possibly just in search of Acapulco Gold, incredibly good marijuana that wholesaled at $65 a kilo.”	A famous alternative culture epicenter and where Joplin serenaded young hippies.
