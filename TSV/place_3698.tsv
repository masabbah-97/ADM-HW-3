In addition to an increasing collection of locks, the Shoreditch fence also features colored wool and twine woven around the diamond-shaped mesh in the shape of hearts.It is ironic that diagonally opposite the site is a locksmith, but it’s unknown if scorned lovers have ever demanded his services.	Lovers proclaim their unbreakable bond by leaving their names on locks fastened onto the Shoreditch fence in East London.
