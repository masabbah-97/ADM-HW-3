Started as a married couple’s personal home collection they call pinball collecting “an incurable disease.” The museum has also hosted some unique machines created by artists, all fully playable of course. Clearly, a labor of love, both the owners continue to hold down regular jobs while running the pinball museum on the side. The museum has an admission cost of $20, but once inside all the machines are free to play, and beer and soda are available for purchase.
