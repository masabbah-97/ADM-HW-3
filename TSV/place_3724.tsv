The pavement consists of concrete mixed with recycled glass, which reduces the amount of heat absorption throughout the day. The public restroom also features tiles made from recycled glass, as well as a digital jukebox that allows occupants to create a music playlist while inside.The Helios House is an experimental project designed to inform and encourage people on the balance between using energy and exercising social responsibility. To that end, patrons are free to pick up a “postcard you can plant,” which contains seeds embedded into the paper fibers.	First LEED-certified gas station in the United States.
