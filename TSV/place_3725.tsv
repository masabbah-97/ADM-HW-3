Visit his studio, and you’ll discover marbles rolling through yards and yards of metal and carefully crafted wood, as well as watch what may be the world’s most complicated way to pour a cup of tea.This place is full of machines moving themselves, with curves and marbles everywhere, making your imagination bend and curve as well. The works of art all look like intricate contraptions, yet their various pieces move with ease, as if by magic.Photos don’t really do justice to these installations, so if you want to get wooed by kinetic art, go and make an appointment to have a look.
