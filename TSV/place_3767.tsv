The six foot tall mouse is charming and strange at the same time… there’s something about a rodent with giant claws that can’t help but be a tad unsettling. He can be found at Faneuil Hall marketplace. Update 2015: Sadly Lobster Mickey is no longer present. He got auctioned off in 2005 for 9000$ to an unknown bidder.	"This ""life-size"" depiction of Mickey Mouse as a half-lobster is both whimsical and a bit creepy, standing guard over the Boston waterfront."
