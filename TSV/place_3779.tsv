One of the Lake Michigan Waterfalls, it’s a result of the Niagara Escarpment. It’s best to visit in the spring but also has fascinating ice structures during the winter months. An old bridge stretches above the falls with stone stairs leading down into the gorge. 	A lovely hidden waterfall right off the highway is well worth a stop.
