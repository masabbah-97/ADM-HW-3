With botanical delights from the rock garden to Victorian glasshouses contain different zones such as temperate, ferns, cycads, alpine tufa house, orchids, and cryptogamic plants to the Chinese hillside dotted with pagodas, pond, and waterfalls, an afternoon spent strolling the vivid alleys of The Royal Botanic Garden will delight one’s mind as well as raise awareness of nature’s fragile biodiversity.The Greenhouse also contains the Sabal Palm tree, which may be the oldest in the world at 200 years and counting. Sadly, due to a multi-million pound renovations, the palm tree had to be felled in 2021. However, the oldest living plant at the gardens is one of Britain’s biggest fossilized trees measuring nearly 35 feet (10.5 meters).  	One of the oldest scientific gardens in Britain, containing more than 13,302 plant species in its core collection.
