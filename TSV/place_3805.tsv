On December 8, 1971, police mounted an operation aiming to remove the squatters from the premises, leading to a large-scale protest and confrontation during which police assailed the crowd with tear gas and batons. The German political rock group Ton Steine Scherben were affiliated with the commune, and described the scene in their protest anthem “Rauch-Haus-Song” the next year.Today, the Georg-von-Rauch-Haus continues to operate as a free living collective with around 40 members at any given time. The ever-present graffiti ringing the lower level of the building makes sure that all passersby recognize the building’s importance. The structure itself was damaged by an apparent arson attempt in 2011, but it continues to play host to a number of musical and cultural events, much like Hamburg’s Rote Flora.	Named after a militant urban guerilla, this famous former squat is a graffiti-covered stronghold of leftist culture.
