Complicating the issue further are what are said to be the graves of seven saints that are marked with ancient Celtic crosses which could also have contributed to the moniker.Whatever the origin, there are really only two churches on the site, which are surrounded by the footprints of a number of monastic dwellings where the devotees would have lived. The largest and most complete of the ruins, St. Breacan’s Church (“Tempall Bhreacán”), still features ornate stonework and bears the name of a saint that moved to the area in the 5th century. The second church, The Church of the Hollow (“Teampall an Phoill”), was actually added to the site much later, around the 15th century, and is markedly smaller than its larger neighbor, but nonetheless as wondrously intact.The ancient ruins are open to sightseers and pilgrims, but the site is still an active graveyard holding not only the supposed bones of saints, but also the remains of modern locals.	While only two of the ancient buildings at this site are actually churches this was one of the earliest Irish pilgrimage sites ever.
