Here he learned how to cast bells and recast a cracked bell for his own church, the Second Church, creating the first bell ever cast in Boston.Apparently it wasn’t a great first job. “The sound is not clear and prolonged, from the lips to the crown shrill.” said Reverend William Bentley.At the Paul Revere house, the courtyard has a bell and a small mortar and a copper hull pin from the USS Constitution, made by Paul Revere & Sons.	The first bell ever cast in Boston was cast by Paul Revere...and sounded terrible.
