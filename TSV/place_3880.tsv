Black rivers and bubbling pools of sulfuric mud cut through a landscape that’s rich with colorful minerals and is continuously steaming. While picturesque,  one of Námaskarð’s most notable characteristics simply cannot be captured by photography – the smell. Oh, the smell! The eggy stench from the sulphuric mud and steam is pungent and unrelenting. It’s enough to make you woozy if you get too close to a steam vent. There’s a reason why you won’t find vegetation in Námaskarð. Take one deep breath in and you’ll know right away. Námaskarð is a magnificent example of how strange and “unearthly” our planet’s natural landscapes can be, and just how pungent they can be as well. 	A sulfuric martian landscape that looks far better than it smells.
