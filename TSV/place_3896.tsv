Back home after her desert adventure, she now towers above the island on the Great Lawn, dwarfing the cityscape of San Francisco, book-ended by the Bay and Golden Gate bridges behind her.Weighing in at 7,000 pounds, Bliss Dance’s elegant form is constructed of triangulated geodesic struts, skinned in a steel mesh that reflects the sunlight. By night she is illuminated from within by 1,000 LEDs.In October 2016 the Bliss Dance statue moved from San Francisco to Las Vegas after being bought by MGMGrand. Its new location is at The Park. Her sister, “Truth is Beauty,” can be found in San Leandro.	An enormous illuminated figure dances on the Las Vegas strip.
