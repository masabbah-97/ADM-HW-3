0	Giant Prairie Dog	roadside attractions,statues	564	651	Outside of Badlands National Park there is a prairie dog of a disturbing size.Surrounded by an actual prairie dog colony, this concrete giant towers 12 ft. over its little friends at a whopping 6 tons. The attraction is free, and for $.50 you can buy peanuts at the Ranch Store Gift Shop to feed the (in comparison) teensy prairie dogs of the non-concrete variety. The massive pink and ocher mascot to the colony below has been watching over this little corner of the Badlands for over 50 years, and despite a little weather wear and tear, shows no sign of going anywhere anytime soon. 	A six-ton, 12-foot-tall concrete prairie dog is touted as the largest in the world.
