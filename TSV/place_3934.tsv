Ruled a suicide, some believe he was murdered. Devastated fans flocked to Solutions Studios, where the album cover for “Figure 8” was shot. Soon the wall was covered in messages, the street littered with candles, flowers, and empty booze bottles. Eight years later, you can read the sentiments of his fans and member this tortured artist through the eyes and art of his fans.	Pay your respects to a folk-punk legend.
