Inside, above the door, you’ll find a curious gem on display: a Snow White–themed mural, painted by the actual artists who animated the Disney film.The exact origin of the artwork is debated, and the strange message on the mural, “We hope we have pleased you!” offers little clue. The website Only in Hollywood explores several theories: Some say the mural was gifted as a token of their appreciation, as the cafe was a hangout for Disney animators—and Walt himself—who came to brainstorm over cups of coffee. Others say the building’s remodel coincided with the premiere of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (which opened at the Vogue Theatre down the street) and the space was decorated for the film’s after-party. The restaurant’s website provides these instructions: “When you come in, look up above the entrance and you’ll see a historical mural crafted by the very hands that gave life to this Disney classic.” Those in search of sustenance and a quick escape from the chaos outside may want to partake in the cafe’s no-frills American fare and beer. Otherwise, passersby are free to pop in and admire the Snow White–inspired works dotting the space. While there are plenty of dwarves and witches that may have been painted around the time of the film’s release, the restaurant can confirm that only the mural above the door is from the original Disney animators.According to LA Magazine, the cafe boasts another connection to legendary children’s movies of the day: The building was designed by Carl Jules Weyl—the art director of The Adventures of Robin Hood—in 1929.	This Hollywood dive houses a mural painted by the artists who animated its namesake film.
