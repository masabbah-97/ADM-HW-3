Though beautiful, it has an alarmingly sinister nickname: Murder Hole Beach.It’s unclear where the beach’s macabre moniker comes from. Some legends say it refers to the tragic tale of a woman who fatally fell—or was potentially pushed—from its cliffs. But in reality, it’s most likely the name is a nod to the wild waters that whip around the shore, as the beach is known for its particularly mighty tides.Regardless of its foreboding name and the genuine dangers of its waters, the beach is worth a visit. This hidden gem has the type of sunkissed, fiery sands you’d expect to find on an Iberian beach. The colorful beach is but one part of a breathtaking Irish landscape, complete with hidden caves and spectacular rock formations.When the tide is out, you can walk to a section of the beach usually separated by the ocean, or clamber over some sharp rocks to reach it instead. When the tide’s out, you can also walk to a small tidal island roughly 50 feet (15 meters) from the shore.The tide isn’t the only thing to be aware of. To reach the beach, you’ll have to cross two fields full of free-roaming animals, namely cows. There are signs about bulls in the fields, but this is not always the case.
