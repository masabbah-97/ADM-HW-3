You can’t get close to it because of the size of the property, which is closed to passersby, but you can get close enough to take pictures of the unique site.The Dixie Cup Corporation moved to Lexington in 1958. The water tower was constructed almost immediately after the move. The corporation has since been incorporated into the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, but the water tower has remained. The city refused to remove the Dixie Cup Water Tower as the nearby airport uses it as a point of reference.Around the corner is the Coca-Cola plant with the spaceship conference room and a shipping warehouse for Amazon.com is also nearby.	Unique tower has outlasted a takeover of the company.
