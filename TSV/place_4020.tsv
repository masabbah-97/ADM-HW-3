Footing can be treacherous at times and visitors should keep a careful eye on the water, because there are numerous lava arches and holes that spout with water when there are large waves. Out along the lava beds, you can find rusted-out car parts, large pieces of worn glass, and even more glass pieces that have been embedded into the lava rock. It’s an incredible view of nature absorbing and incorporating man’s trash and transforming it into something surreal, even beautiful.	This industrial area was the dumping ground for massive amounts of trash, some of which washes up as tiny bits of sea glass.
