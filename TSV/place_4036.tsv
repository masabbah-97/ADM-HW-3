Tourists travel from miles around for a glimpse of its natural beauty. Its name means “Blue Eye,” and it is mesmerizing to gaze into its portal. This spring is unique for its appearance as a deep sapphire blue “hole” beneath the surface of more tranquil turquoise water — a color scheme typically only observed in saltwater springs. Divers have made it down 50 meters into the water, but its true depth has yet to be revealed. 	A naturally beautiful, seemingly bottomless deep blue spring.
