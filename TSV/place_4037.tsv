Amongst these one grand carriage stands out, entirely lined in black fabric, which was used by the widows. This gloomy funerary ambience was meant to induce a state of mourning, which–considering they were widows–wouldn’t seem to need inducing.The Museum is overflowing with iconographic displays of mortality, which apart from being represented by the Christian Cross, are present in all the carriages illustrating the diverse manners that the transition between life and death is exemplified. Among the symbols are the Greek letters alpha and omega reflecting the beginning and end, many sculpted angels along with stained glass and hourglasses reflecting the limitation of man’s life.Quite common as well is the figure of the owl, which on one hand represents solitude and silence, as death itself; and, on the other hand, wisdom, which linked to the Greek Goddess Athena, presupposes that man encounters true wisdom in the transition between death and the beyond.One thing which ties all the carriages together is the baroque rococo beauty with which they ushered the dead to their final resting places. 	This Funeral Hearse Museum represents the finest in cadaver transportation.
