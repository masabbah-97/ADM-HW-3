Inspired by the treehouses of her youth, Kara O’Brien was immediately struck with a vision to create something magical in this space.Using her experience, O’Brien set out to design a treehouse that sprouted from the forest floor using only sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood and other salvaged goods. Originally intended as a personal space, O’Brien’s growing number of rescued llamas and the alluring draw of the treehouse soon brought many visitors. Seeing that people from all over wanted to share in the wonder of this space, O’Brien began hosting visitors to the treehouse to support and grow her rescue operation. Today, the treehouse has gained national recognition as dozens of visitors have swung from the bed swing beneath the treehouse or fed carrots to the llamas and alpacas. Few realize that right off a busy Atlanta highway is a wondrous hideaway for llamas, alpacas, and curious visitors alike. 	This wondrous hideaway is suspended in a bamboo forest above a sanctuary for rescued llamas and alpacas.
