Wilmot quickly moved on, but Center of the World managed to survive as a community. Today the small area doesn’t contain much more than a few houses and retail spaces, but the main attraction is the road sign stating the community’s name. A popular photo subject, the sign has actually been stolen and replaced a number of times as it is the sole tourist attraction in the area. Despite the town’s small size, it’s hard to feel insignificant standing at the Center of the World. 	A grandiose title could not save this mercantile community from obscurity.
