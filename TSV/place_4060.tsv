The collection runs from the 19th century to the 1980s, with a particular emphasis on toys popular in Mexico, but there is plenty here that non-Mexican toy fans can appreciate. Anyone looking for a typical museum with ordered cases and rows of labeled objects may be in for a shock at Kinoshita’s collection. His is more of an explosive celebration of toys and childhood than a scholarly exercise in trinket history. Every last inch of the space is packed with toys, often in whimsical display cases built either by the founder himself or local craftsman. A lot of the cases are made from salvaged items, like large industrial light fixtures. There’s occasionally a theme to various corners, but for the most part it’s simply floor after floor of delightful chaos. One of the highlights is a giant, two-story-tall head (of questionable racial appropriateness) with two maracas, rescued from a defunct nightclub, that fills the inner atrium.The first floor houses a gift shop that is only somewhat more organized than the museum. They sell vintage toys to support the museum, also giving visitors an opportunity to start a collection of their own.A recent addition to the museum is the creation of a street art “speakeasy” on the rooftop. It is called a speakeasy due to the fact that it is not open unless a special request is made at the front desk for access. It not only affords visitors an opportunity to view some paintings by a mix of very talented Mexican and international artists, but includes a bonus rooftop view of the surrounding neighborhood.	Visiting this cacophonous collection of vintage novelties is like stepping into the mind of a crazed toymaker.
