The site, located deep in the middle of the woods, is now marked with a cement plateau which culminates in an installed boulder with the names of the crash victims etched into the top. There is also a small gazebo with an informational collage about the singer. What the site lacks in grandeur it makes up for in an atmosphere of quiet reflection.	An engraved boulder marks the spot where Patsy Cline's life ended in a plane crash.
