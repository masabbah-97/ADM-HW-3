You’ll need a keen eye to spot it, as it’s easy to overlook.The garden is part of the Briscoe Western Art Museum, which is housed in what was originally San Antonio’s first public library. The museum’s collection, dedicated to preserving and educating people about the Old West, has grown in size over the years. So too has the collection inside the secluded sculpture garden.A short path through a gate off to the side of the Jack Guenther Pavilion leads to the open courtyard. A collection of bronze western-themed statues made by some of the best-known Western artists in the United States fills the space.The sculptures are all classic images from Wild West history. Artwork showing Native Americans, European settlers, and animals like horses, lizards, cougars, and snakes abounds. Growing among the sculptures are native grasses and desert plants that fit perfectly with the garden’s ambiance.The garden offers places to both walk around and sit in the sun or shade. A paved open space exists in the center where events and perhaps dancing occur from time to time. Weddings and receptions have been held there as well.	This hidden sculpture garden full of Wild West art is one of San Antonio's best-kept secrets.
