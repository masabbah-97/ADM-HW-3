Thanks to the previous generation’s proclivity for throwing their garbage in the ocean, Fort Bragg is home to beaches with the highest concentration of sea glass in the world.The three-room museum holds thousands of rare and unusual sea glass pieces in every color, shape, and size. A display organized by color explains the origin of each sea glass color (rare red pieces are usually tail lights from underwater cars, lavender is white glass clarified with magnesium and oxidized by the sun). Some colors fluoresce under a black light display. Capt. Cass has also collected barely recognizable bottle stoppers, marbles, and terracottas. 	Celebrating the transformation of trash into objects of beauty.
