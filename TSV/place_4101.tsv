(Trap, Neuter, Release is what the acronym TNR stands for.) The feral population is kept stable via this humane and pragmatic practice, versus capturing and culling, and spares the lives of these street cats.In return, the cats keep the rodent population at bay all across the Greenpoint waterfront.
