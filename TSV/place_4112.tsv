To take matters further, the geometrics of the home create a safer, aerodynamic, earthquake-resistant structure. For example: the home is a perfect ellipse shape thus relieving wind friction. Or, just in case you were concerned, the owners installed four water jets on the exterior of the home in case of neighborhood fire.On the whole it seems that the Berkley ‘Fish House’ has been built as if it were a living organism, responding to outside stimuli. Just look at it, with its scales, fins, and gills one would almost expect it to start breathing.	A private home built to resemble the shape of a microscopic creature.
