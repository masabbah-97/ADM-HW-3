Diners can tuck into a kamayan-style buffet of fish, rice, barbecued chicken and bananas (the latter is locally known as “banana cue”), fresh fruit, and more, all spread across banana leaves. The small falls, known as Labasin Falls, is not actually a natural falls, but instead is the runoff from the Labasin Dam, the Philippines’ first hydroelectric plant. But despite being an artificial falls that runs beneath the tables at the Waterfalls Restaurant, the uniqueness of the experience is very real.	An eatery in a shallow river where diners can enjoy their meal mere feet from the base of an artificial waterfall.
