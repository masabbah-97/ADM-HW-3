When the toad failed to show up for their regular meeting by the light of a vending machine, they wondered, “Where can he hide? Where can he be?” This phrase went on to inspire a children’s book, the first of many to come out of the publishing company. Later, the Zieslers restored one of Ladysmith’s original houses and founded an arts center there. They named it Toad House. Much like the publishing company, the house seeks to cultivate “the wonder of childhood and beauty in nature.”Toad House offers events for “like-minded toads” such as felting classes, “Knit and Chat” meetings, and writing workshops. The bakery, always open, offers handmade European treats and beverages made from family recipes passed down through generations. Also of note are the Enchanted Woods behind the Toad House, where adventurers might happen upon some actual toads.	A fairytale art house in the middle of Wisconsin.
