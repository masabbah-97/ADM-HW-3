The road was originally installed in 1914 by Thomas Rodd, during the time when wood-block paving was thought to help deaden some of the cacophony caused by horse-and-wagon traffic.The old road has managed to survive for over a century in the automobile age. Designated a historic landmark, it underwent a community-backed restoration in 1985. Residents of the 18 homes that border Roslyn Place still keep wooden blocks on hand to perform spot repairs. One of Roslyn Place’s former residents, Allan Jacobs, features this amazing wooden street in his book, Great Streets.	The last street in Pittsburgh that's paved with wood.
