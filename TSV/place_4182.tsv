The settlers named the town Iosepa (pronounced “Yo-see-pa”), Hawaiian for “Joseph,” after Joseph F. Smith, the president of the Church at the time.With considerable effort, the 46 islanders, accustomed to the tropics, managed to raise crops and animals to sustain themselves in the harsh, arid climate. They created streets with names like “Honolulu” and “Kula,” planted trees, built a reservoir, and even experimented with growing their own seaweed. For a short time, the settlement thrived; the population blossomed to 228 by 1915.Disease and crop failure took a toll, however, and the final nail in the coffin occurred when the Church built its first temple in Hawai’i. Many residents chose to return to the islands, and the town was completely deserted by 1917.Iosepa has been abandoned for more than a century. Only scant remnants of the town are visible today: a few building foundations, a curious row of fire hydrants buried in sage brush, and of course the cemetery, where descendants of the settlers gather each year. They maintain the family graves, decorating them with seashells and flower leis, and enjoy a pig roast, dancing, and other festivities to celebrate their history.
