Rather, it’s to offer to students, and anyone interested in the subject matter, real and direct contact with the tools and history of forensic medicine and criminal studies.The museum is named for university professor Reverte Coma, who started the first forensic and paleopathology laboratory in Spain, founded in 1980. He was trained in the United States by FBI specialists, and the knowledge he acquired has helped solve many difficult murder cases in Spain.	The morbid items in this small and hidden museum are not for the weak stomached.
