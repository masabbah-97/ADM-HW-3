Titled “Thinking Inside the Box,” the work has a clear but nonetheless important message. At a staggering height of 85 feet, the massive cube-shaped sculpture with a chin, actually houses three floors of books in a perfect melding of art and education.Although unclear in the bright sunshine of the French Riviera, the floors of the library can be seen at night when it is illuminated through the canvas that covers its exterior. Whether the metaphor applies to you, or another other sun-soaked pedestrian on the streets of Nice, its imposing figure remains intriguing.	This massive blockhead sculpture hides an entire library.
