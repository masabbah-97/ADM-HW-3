Each year hundreds of onlookers gather on the lawn of Chapman school, from about an hour before sunset to about a half hour after, to watch the Swifts gather, organize, perform aerial maneuvers, and finally funnel in a black fluttering cloud into the chimney to roost.  Onlookers often arrive with blankets and a supper to complement the experience.	Tens of thousands of tiny birds swarm into one school chimney every fall.
