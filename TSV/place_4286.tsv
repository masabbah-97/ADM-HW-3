0	The Creation Museum	hoaxes and pseudoscience,strange science,dinosaurs,animals	359	612	Opening its door in May of 2007, the Creation Museum is a 70,000-square-foot institution dedicated to presenting an account of the origins of the universe according to the very literal, creationist perspective of the Book of Genesis. Whether you’re interested in walking through the pages of “God’s Word” (equipped with life-size dinosaurs) or enjoying a family-friendly picnic in the recreated Garden of Eden, there’s plenty of activities for you to explore your inner-Creationist, as long as the information presented being at odds with science doesn’t disturb you. The museum boasts 160 exhibits documenting Earth’s history, asserting that all life forms were created 6,000 years ago over a six-day period. Take a minute to explore the re-creation of Noah’s Ark work-site (again, with dinosaurs!) or watch some fantastic “Theater Presentations” such as Men in White, Six Days of Creation or a classic, Dinosaurs, and Dragons.According to the founder, Ken Ham: “One of the main reasons we moved there [Petersburg, Kentucky] was because we are within one hour’s flight of 69 percent of America’s population.” Which means that 69 percent of the U.S. is just a short trip away from experiencing what a very specific, faith-based approach to human history looks like. 	A 70,000-square-foot institution dedicated to a very literal, creationist perspective on the Book of Genesis.
