Commissioned by local politician, John Cargill, son of Captain William Cargill, in the 1870s, the tunnel is the primary draw, but not the only draw, of the area, which is also known for the beauty of its rugged sandstone cliffs, rock arches, and caves.To reach the beach today, visitors must trek across private farmland. The path, which was opened in 1983, descends from about 500 feet above sea level and is located just a short distance from Blackhead Road. The path winds its way to the top of the tunnel, which then leads guests down 72 steps to the beach.The tunnel is a bit spooky. Naturally lit, the tunnel is quite dark and if you speak at a low enough pitch while inside of it, it resonates loudly from one end to the other.	Known for the tunnel that leads visitors to the water.
