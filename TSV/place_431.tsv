While there were originally two additional Earth Rooms, both in Germany, this is the last one remaining.To keep the Earth Room in good shape, curators must regularly water the dirt. Occasional mushrooms have been found sprouting in the 280,000 pounds of dirt. Though it would be a difficult piece to transport and reinstall elsewhere, it is estimated to be worth at least a million dollars. The space itself, in Manhattan’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, is probably worth much more.	A room in New York City that contains 250 cubic yards of dirt worth a million dollars.
