Numerous rare and intriguing works of art line the walls and display cases.Of particular note is the only watercolor of a rattlesnake by John J. Audubon, which illustrates the snake being attacked by a flock of birds. And a beautiful opium jar from 1910 is carved in the shape of a skull with a viper woven through the eye sockets to indicate poison.The gift shop features an array of charming gifts, as one might imagine of a snake museum. One highlight: snake fangs from the Gabon Viper, which boasts the longest fangs in the world, are available for individual purchase.	A museum devoted entirely to the rattlesnakes and snake-related art.
