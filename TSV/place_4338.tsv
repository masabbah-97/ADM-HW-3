The home is rated a Grade I by English Heritage, making it one of the most important Gothic Revival homes in all of England.The house is recognized by many as it was used for the exterior shots of the film The Secret Garden. The house was also used as a shooting location for the film 1920 and the television series Lost in Austen.The nearby St. Martin’s church contains several tomb-monuments for the Mauleverer family, which owned the home prior to 1786. The interior that was put into the house during the 18th century remains intact to this day.The castle contains seven principal reception rooms, 45 bedrooms, and 18 bathrooms. It also has its own chapel inside. The great hall, one of the most impressive rooms in the building, has ceilings that are 80 feet high. The room is adorned by intricately carved oak paneling and filled with stained glass windows. In the center of the house, the great hall branches off into the drawing room, the blue and white ballroom, the library and other rooms.On the grounds of the castle, visitors will find an 18th-century stable block constructed of dark-colored stones as well as a huge kitchen garden.As the home is maintained and operated by the Gerald Arthur Rolph Foundation for Historic Preservation and Education, it remains in incredible condition. (Gerald Arthur Rolph was an American businessman.) It also helps that the structure was largely rebuilt between 1843 and 1853.
