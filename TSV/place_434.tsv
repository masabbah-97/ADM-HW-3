The waterfall has carved a mossy cylindrical chamber into the rock which can only be reached through a thin crack in the outside cliff wall.Once through the crack, explorers are hit with the incredible majesty of the hidden waterfall as it crashes into a pool at the base of the cave. The interior of the cave is nearly completely covered in a thin carpet of greenery thanks to the continually moist surroundings. These clandestine waterworks distill the natural wonder of Iceland’s scenic beauty.	This fantastical waterfall is hidden in a cave located in a cracked cliff.
