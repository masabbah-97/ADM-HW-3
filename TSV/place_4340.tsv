The full-sized sculptures are based on actual fossil skeletons. One display combines robotic dinosaurs and a high tech sound system to make a “life-like” dinosaur encounter.The park also includes entrance into the Elizabeth Dee Shaw Stewart Museum which houses the latest dinosaur finds in Utah and around the world. Full-size dinosaur skeletons tower over informative displays of actual fossils, replicas and models. The museum also includes a working paleontology lab where visitors can observe real dinosaur bones being prepared for display.A children’s dig of a Stegosaurus skeleton along with other hands on activities are found at the Education Center.
