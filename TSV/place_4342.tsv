Others reference popular culture or reflect the artists’ own unique designs.Every year, a festival is held to celebrate this street, where artists add new murals to the existing collection. Dozens of artists descend upon the alley, which continues to serve as a canvas for their creativity. It’s a way for the people of Phoenix to bring quite a few splashes of color to their concrete desert oasis.	This small, unassuming street is now a canvas for color and creativity.
