You can choose from a variety of classes, but Executive Class and Upper Dome Class are most enticing.The former offers seating in the newly restored Saint Lucie Sound car, a luxury lounge car from the days when streamlining was all the rage. The Upper Dome cars offer panoramic views under a glass dome, so passengers can take in the rivers, trees, and wildlife of the area. The route operates year round, but the railroad also hosts an abundance of unique experiences outside of the normal schedule, such as murder mystery solving, mixology classes, and wine tasting while painting. You can also choose to bring your bike aboard, hop off the train when you want to explore, and hop back on when you’re ready to go home. 	A throwback train ride transports passengers through one of the lesser-known national parks in the country.
