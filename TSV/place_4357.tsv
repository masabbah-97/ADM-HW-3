Along the way, the southernmost cross-country interstate highway in the U.S. passes through an Arizona town of fewer than 500 people. Picacho is named for the nearby Picacho Mountains, but its claim to fame is the Rooster Cogburn Ostrich Ranch.Rooster Cogburn Ostrich Ranch has been owned by the same family for three generations. The farm in the middle of the desert has been open to the public since 1999, when the only attraction was feeding the ostriches. Since then, theyâ€™ve added miniature donkeys and goats, deer, ducks, stingrays, and a beloved group of rainbow lorikeets, who live in a 5,000 square foot tropical greenhouse.The operational ostrich farm and petting zoo hybrid has been featured in a number of television shows, and every weekend and some holidays, they offer an educational monster truck tour of the facility which covers the ostrich industry, local wildlife, and the Picacho Mountains.
