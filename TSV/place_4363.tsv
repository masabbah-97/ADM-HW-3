What fewer people know is that the institute is home to an extremely impressive collection of art relating to human sexuality.The collection includes artistic treasures from all around the world, and going back in history more than 2,000 years. A rotating collection of unique artworks, artifacts, documents and objects can be seen in the Gallery at the institute. These range from works by the likes of Picasso and Chagal, to a fine collection of “Tijuana Bibles” — small pornographic comic books from the 1930s and 40s — to ancient handmade Japanese books with color woodblock prints of sexual positions.If you can’t make it to Bloomington, the Kinsey Collection also now has images some of the art and artifacts available to browse digitally.Update September 2018: The gallery is closed. But if you get a chance, check out the greenhouse that’s located right nearby. 	A lesser-known part of the Kinsey Institute is this impressive collection of art relating to human sexuality.
