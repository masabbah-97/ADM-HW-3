The Diefenbunker was in operation for 33 years before it was turned into a museum in 1998, and opened to the public.The Diefenbunker has also been used as a movie set and all through the summer, cold war related movies are shown in the Diefenbunker. A highlight among the exhibitions is “Lost Nuke: The World’s First Broken Arrow is the story of the first ‘lost’ nuclear weapon, featuring artifacts from the site of the infamous plane crash.”	Canada's subterranean Cold War museum has doubled as a movie set.
