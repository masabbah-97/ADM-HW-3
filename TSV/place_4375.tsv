Travelers who’ve happened upon the temple in their journeys have described an interior in mild disrepair but filled with stunning statues and shrines, including a giant bronze Buddha. The dragon itself is reportedly hollow, and visitors are able to walk some sections of it, though other parts of the temple remain closed to the public.	An enormous dragon scales the walls of this 17-story temple.
