The Schwebebahn Dresden connects the urban parts of Loschwitz and Oberloschwitz and runs on a nearly 900-foot track, held up by 33 towers, of which the tallest has a height of about 46 feet.The Schwebebahn or “floating train” of Dresden was designed by Eugen Langen, who built also the Schwebebahn in Wuppertal, and it went into service in 1901, making it the oldest suspension railway in the world.It was out of service between 1984 and 1992 as it was being restored. Despite looking much more precarious than your standard cable car, or trolley, the Schwebebahns have an immensely good safety record.	A unique hanging cable-car navigates through Dresden, the oldest suspension railway in the world.
