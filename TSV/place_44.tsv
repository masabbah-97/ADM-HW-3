The abundant freshwater has allowed a diverse population of trees and vegetation to emerge surrounding the pool, forming what is now a protected nature preserve.The first thing visitors marvel at is the deep overhang etched into the far wall of the pool — remnants of a natural dome that once concealed the entire grotto underground until it collapsed more than a century ago. The sheer cavern now provides deep shade and rocky exploration for visitors.Waterfalls routinely fall from the lip of the overhang, flowing down the 50-foot drop and splashing into the cool water below, making this a beautiful and refreshing location for sunbaked summer adventurers and swimmers. In case of the high levels of certain bacteria, the pool is closed for swimming.Besides being a popular tourist attraction, this place is a rich ecosystem. The ceiling of the pool and cliffs surrounding the grotto are home to moss, cliff swallows, and maidenhair fern.	An emerald-green grotto just a short trip from Austin.
