First they removed some bones and cut them into small pieces to be set in very small, glass-covered containers—one of which is set in the wooden cross that the priest uses to bless the congregation during devotions. His body was then clothed with Bishop’s robes and his face covered in a smooth, white mask mimicking his features.To the side of the Shrine is a small museum dedicated to the life and death of St. John Neumann. This includes old photographs, sculptures, books, jewelry, coffins, and especially haunting instruments of self-mortification. Behind the altar is the Bohemian-born saint’s personal collection of hundreds of relics from other saints. These include teeth, bones, skulls, and other miscellaneous and unidentifiable bits and pieces.While the shrine is the real draw, it’s also worthwhile to ask one of the monitors to see the church. If they’re obliging, it’s an amazing piece of architecture, complete with a chapel dedicated to a plague which, lore has it, affected the entire city but spared the members of Neumann’s parish.
