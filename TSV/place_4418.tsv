Inside the vibrant store, the owners encourage people to “try before you buy” and charge by weight of the bag, so customers can choose an assortment of sweets.The store also sells gifts and souvenirs, but a delicious and decorative assortment of candies wrapped in characteristic packaging is a gift in itself.  The store creates a fun, free environment for kids to choose any candy they can imagine, and a space sprinkled with innuendos for the adults. Regardless of your age, Suck and Chew is delicious.Update 2016: The shop is no longer in business and is now a trendy coffee shop/bakery.  	"""Purveyors of traditional sweets and vintage treats."""
