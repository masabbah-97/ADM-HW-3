In addition to its ultra-modern design, featuring luxurious built-in pieces of furniture, the floor-to-ceiling windows offer sweeping views of Los Angeles. The unique luxury and unbeatable view have made the home a perfect location for filming and has been featured in a variety of movies such as Charlie’s Angels, Pulp Fiction, and The Big Lebowski. The house has been used so many times, the unique triangular design of the ceiling leaves many viewers with a feeling of déjà vu.	An ultra-modern vista that has been featured in so many films the house is a celebrity in its own right.
