Gee gave the spaceship its name in honor of Pegasus, Zeus’s winged horse in Greek mythology; a ship named the USS Pegasus (NCC-53847) in the Star Trek TV series; and Betty and Barney Hill, who claimed to have been abducted by aliens from the Pegasus Constellation in the 1960s.It was originally operated as a restaurant and family entertainment center but closed in 2007. The site hosted a flea market in the early 2010s.Update: Unfortunately, in May 2017 the site was demolished about a year after McDonald’s bought the property.	A starship has landed in Texas, a welcome break for weary travelers from a drab stretch of I-35.
