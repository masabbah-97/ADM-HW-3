There are currently three shows, a holiday-themed one, a journey through the stars, and the regular “America- the House We Live In.” The silo was previously painted in a sky pattern with a face on it, but has since been repainted to black, with an ad for the mall it is attached to.The gift shop contains all things Kaleidoscope, with fine-art kaleidoscopes going for up to a thousand dollars. Its neighbors now include a resort and spa.	The world's largest kaleidoscope, designed by a 1960s psychedelic artist.
