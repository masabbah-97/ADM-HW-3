Inspired by the Dublin Writers Museum, the museum is an interactive, immersive approach over the old-school library vibe. A literal rainbow of books line the ceiling, A Nation of Writers exhibit is home to a comprehensive timeline of American literary history—with special attention paid to women and writers of color. Two of the museum’s premiere highlights are the Surprise Bookshelf, a playground of sights and sounds and smells, and the Word Waterfall that is both mesmerizing and endless. There is also an impressive collection of usable typewriters, on which guests can write their story. Walls and touchscreen tables gamify the writing experience. If you ever wanted to learn just how many authors enjoyed a good drink every now and then, here’s your chance. The museum hosts rotating exhibits and events along with author readings and children’s storytimes. The museum is available for event rentals just in case anyone wants to be married under Hemingway’s watchful eye.	Small and slightly hidden, the American Writers Museum is preserving the legacy of America's finest authors.
