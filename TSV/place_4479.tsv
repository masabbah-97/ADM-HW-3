However, Møns Klint is a beach unlike any other.Upon arriving, one is greeted by a thick forest of twisting tree trunks and precarious hills. The forest can only be described as ancient; it is no wonder fossils were found here. Upon descending the steep and winding staircase, visitors are greeted with a humbling view of towering chalk-white cliffs contrasted by a teal sea. The large, bleached cliffs provide a unique backdrop for a day at the beach. Formed by shells of millions of microscopic creatures, the chalk cliffs were formed when glaciers began to move west. They then emerged when the ice melted away. Visitors also sometimes find fossils of shellfish mixed into the rocky beach. In addition to the unique geological setting, the chalky soil makes a variety of unique plants and marshes possible. Visitors can play on the rocks littered in the shallow surf or simply sit and listen to the ineffable sound of the waves hitting the rocky beach. Other activities include camping, hiking or cycling along the tops of the cliffs, kayaking, or visiting the visitor center for information about the fossils and rocks found at the site. Møns Klint remains untouched by time and a visit here evokes that boundless feeling. 	A natural wonder in south Denmark.
