Situated in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka, the fortress is surrounded on all sides by the remains of an extensive network of reservoirs and gardens. These gardens are believed to be some of the oldest landscaped gardens anywhere in the world.The Lion staircase leading to the palace garden at the top of the rock is the most significant feature of this geological masterpiece. An intricate construction, the Lion staircase is a tile-covered walkway that emerges from the open mouth of the beast from which it takes its name and is built of brick and timber. The bricks surround ancient limestone steps.Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, this rock is full of archeological importance. The other primary feature that draws thousands of tourists every year is the surviving frescoes and other paintings. The few paintings that survive are the earliest examples of a Sri Lanka school of classical realism, which was fully formed by the 5th century when the paintings at Sigiriya were produced. There are also remains of paintings in some of the caves that are nestled at the foot of the giant rock.According to ancient texts, the entire rock fortress was built by King Kashyapa and, after his death, was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today it is a popular tourist destination and one of the first places added to Sri Lanka itineraries. The climb is accessible to people of all ages and levels of fitness.
