While there are several historic sites along the route of her travels, the Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Historic Home & Museum features the concluding scenes of her life. It is the place where she settled with Almanzo and their daughter, Rose, and where she wrote her Little House books. At this location, visitors will have the opportunity to see and experience Laura’s homes, the historic farmhouse and the Rock House on Rocky Ridge; “Laura’s Vegetable Garden”, an addition created to honor Laura’s passion for gardening. The museum will be of special interest to fans of the Little House series. Here, visitors will discover Pa’s fiddle, handwritten manuscripts for the Little House books, Laura’s needlework, Almanzo’s tools, and many other keepsakes that readers will recognize. Another portion of the museum is dedicated to Rose Wilder Lane. In addition, the museum has collected artifacts that span over a century of pioneering history. 	"Where the author wrote her beloved ""Little House"" books."
