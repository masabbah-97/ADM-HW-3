Despite his fame and wealth, he still lives in his home state, in a rather distinctive mansion just outside of downtown Bangor.The houses in his neighborhood are all large and expensive-looking, but they’re close to the street, which is wide and easily accessible, with a public sidewalk winding throughout. King’s house is red with white trim, towering, and old enough to look historic. It’s also in full view of the street, not hidden behind the small wrought-iron fence that surrounds the property.The fence itself is most of what gives the house its Stephen King-esque flair. Spiders, bat-winged creatures, and a three-headed reptile all decorate the black wrought-iron.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W. OckerUpdate as of February 2021: King left this house around a year ago as he now resides in Florida	The eccentric mansion of one the most popular horror authors of modern times.
