The museum features a number of corridors leading back into the rock and speckled with mannequins performing the various roles fulfilled in 19th century ore collection. In addition to the authentic museum displays, the site also houses a large community space that is used for weddings, bingo, and other social events.The mash-up of tourist display and community center may seem out of place, but given the debt the Creede community owes to the mining of yesteryear it may not be such a strange match after all. 	A fake mine that was made using real mining techniques which is also used as a community center.
