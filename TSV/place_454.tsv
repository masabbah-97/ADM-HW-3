The back room contains several types of carnivorous plants, and an area up front is dedicated to tentacled epiphytes.Paxton Gate hosts some amazing taxidermy classes catered to adults in its shop.In the annex shop down the street, Paxton Gate Curiosities for Kids, they sell unusual toys and puppets, as well as hosting a number of intriguing classes, from insect mounting, to small animal taxidermy, to shadow-puppet making for kids. They regularly host story time and holiday events for children as well.Paxton Gate also offers landscape design services.	A shop full of natural curiosities, carnivorous plants, and costumed taxidermied mice.
