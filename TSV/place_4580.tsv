Flashing their bright plumage, they squawk, chat, and cheerily greet anyone who comes to say hello.The Free Flight Exotic Bird Sanctuary began as an exotic bird breeding and boarding facility in 1981. Since it was founded by Dr. Robert F. Stonebreaker, it has grown into a unique, hands-on sanctuary where birds and humans can interact on a one-of-a-kind level. The place lets people and parrots connect, while also providing a safe, suitable shelter for birds in need of a home.Visitors are encouraged to do more than just look at the sanctuary’s beautiful avian residents. Patrons are provided with scoops of fresh-cut raw fruits and vegetables to feed the birds. To most people’s delight, some of the less shy birds will get chatty and possibly dance alongside you. Interacting with the birds (under the careful supervision of a sanctuary employee) gives the social creatures a healthy dose of the attention they need.Make sure to stop by and see Midori, a particularly cheeky resident. She’ll likely imitate cell phone rings and ask if you can let her out of her cage. There is also a large pond filled with wonderfully colorful Koi fish. The pond was originally a habitat for a flock of rescued flamingos, though they have since all been successfully re-homed.	This unique sanctuary invites you to interact with the beautiful birds.
