The trail was the brainchild of Heather and Jay Harrington, who created it as a way to celebrate living life outdoors in Northern Michigan.  Anyone from the area can participate in the Fairy House Trail, as the designer dwellings are created and placed along and near the dirt pathway throughout the summer and early fall. The following spring, the remnants of the prior year’s tiny homes are removed in time for a new season of designs to be added once again. At the start of this enchanted trail, or the end depending on which direction you’re walking, is an enormous bird’s nest fashioned from sticks and tree limbs. The nest was an Eagle Scout project created in 2015, and is annually repaired and rejuvenated each year after the long winter.   	This enchanting forest trail leads to ethereal abodes and a giant bird's nest.
