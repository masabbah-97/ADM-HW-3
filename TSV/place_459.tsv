0	Stables Market	shops	1820	1973	Originally a local food market dating back to the early 1900s, the Camden Markets expanded rapidly in the 70s when artists and artisans began to open stalls. Stables Market is the largest building in the complex, a warren of hipster shops built into a historic stables building.Previously the Pickfords stables and horse hospital, the complex once housed the sizable herd used to transport goods along the Camden canal. Chain businesses aren’t permitted inside the Stables, and the shops are built into the existing architecture of the stables, railway viaducts and giant bronze cavalry statues.Expanded in 2006 to include two sizable new buildings enclosing space previously used for outdoor stands, the Stables shops mostly consist of vintage wares, alternative clothing and imported ethnic goods. It’s also home to Cyberdog (a cybergoth/raver emporium) and adjacent to the Camden Locks market, where most of the food stalls and pubs are located.	Catacombs turned marketplace.
