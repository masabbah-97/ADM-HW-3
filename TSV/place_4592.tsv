However this uncanny replica in Odaiba stands at only roughly 40 feet tall, about 1/7th the size of its New York counterpart.To celebrate Japan’s ties with France, a Statue of Liberty was temporarily placed in Odaiba from 1998 to 1999. Originally gifted to France by U.S. citizens in 1889 to celebrate the French Revolution, this particular statue was brought all the way from the Île aux Cygnes in Paris. It was returned to Paris in 1999, but due to its popularity, a replica was erected in 2000.Although unrelated, it is worth noting that the place name Odaiba comes from an old Japanese word meaning “fort” or “battery,” while one of the ways to visit Liberty Island in New York City is a ferry ride from The Battery.The statue overlooks the Rainbow Bridge, the unofficial name given by local residents, and Tokyo Bay. With glowing lights, sometimes in rainbow colors for special holidays and events, it creates quite the striking scene behind the Statue of Liberty, and is one of the prettiest views in Tokyo day or night.As if one Statue of Liberty replica was not enough, Japan has at least a couple more scattered about the country, although none are as grand as the New York original.	This little replica of Lady Liberty provides a bit of NYC in a Japanese city.
