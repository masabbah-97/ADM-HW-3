There are over 20,000 items of superman memorabilia, including the only remaining George Reeves costume. An iconic, and much photographed giant Superman statue is just outside the store.Metropolis, Illinois also hosts an annual Superman festival each June.  There are events and activities for all ages.  Of course, Superman is there, and various stars associated with the movies and television series have been known to visit.	You have to love a museum with a truly dedicated focus. A focus on Superman, for example.
