0	North Avenue Baths Facade	Unique Restaurants & Bars	510	581	It seems hard to believe that Wicker Park once supported two European-style bathhouses, but it did.Built in 1922, the North Avenue Baths, with intricate aquatic-themed terra-cotta detailing, boasts a much prettier facade than the surviving Division Street Bathhouse.Yet, by the early 1990s, it was a boarded up ruin, a sad sight from the Blue Line El train.Clever entrepreneurs saw potential in its wrecked shell, and successfully rehabilitated it in the late 1990s.  A prestigious fine-dining establishment, Spring, the first from acclaimed chef Sean McLain, made good use of the ground level while the upper floors were turned into apartments.Although the once-trendy Spring has closed, it’s been replaced by an equally hot “gastro-pub”, the Trenchermen, which has also now closed.	Former bath house turns gastropub.	Coyote Building,Flat Iron Building,Myopic Books	2039 W.
