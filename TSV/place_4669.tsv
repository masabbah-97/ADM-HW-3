In need of repair, the house was ready for its first overhaul. One fateful day, the kitchen floor collapsed under J’s feet while he was doing the dishes. The structure was in such bad shape, it only took one afternoon for J to strip the house down to its frame. Undeterred, J rebuilt Sonja’s dream cottage.Not too many years later, J would set out to transform their home yet again. In the early 1990s, Sonja slowly started losing her eyesight, the result of a degenerative eye disease. One day J made a painted wooden butterfly as a gift for Sonja, and they both quickly realized Sonja was able to make out the bright colors, if little else. Now their home is covered in hundreds of brightly colored wooden butterflies. The dazzling rainbow house delights visitors day and night, as colorful lights keep the butterflies shining bright after dark.	Hopeless romantics will swoon over the sweet story behind this bright and colorful home.
