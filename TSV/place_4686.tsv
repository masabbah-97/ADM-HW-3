During the 1950s the house was to be expanded to become an 18-story hotel complex, but the construction plans petered out leaving the French-styled architecture intact. After serving its time as the Hotel del Salto, the grand old house was abandoned and left to cultivate moss and tales of hauntings.Most recently the gorgeous building has been converted into the Tequendama Falls Museum, displaying wonders of the natural world to complement the organic beauty of the falls that inspired the building’s construction.   	This picturesque mansion has gone from opulent ruin to nature museum.
