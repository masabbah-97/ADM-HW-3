Resting on rocky cliffs above the Mediterranean, fashion designer Pierre Cardin’s bubble house is the perfect eccentric home to inspire his avant garde work.25 years ago, Cardin was hunting for a summer home that would fit his style; both chic and space-age. In Cannes, he found a partially constructed home that caught his fancy. Designed by architect Antti Lovag, an equally legendary man in his field, the bubble house was being built for a French businessman, who died midway through construction. After the death of the first owner, Cardin swooped in and completed the work.Domed inside and out, the curved structure resembles a bunch of space-age grapes, or a series of submarine pods. Combined with the bright blue skies above Cannes and the intermittent palm tree, the house loses its abstract appearance and gives way to unadulterated high fashion and the lifestyles of the upper class.Although the luscious pale-blue of the pool looks too appealing to pass up a trip to Cannes, don’t book your ticket quite yet. The bubble house was famous for hosting events and festivals, but the host is a few months from 90 years old and parties at the bubble house were as exclusive as Cardin’s clothing lines.
