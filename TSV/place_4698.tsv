Crowded on weekends, this museum is an unlikely hit.Exhibits include the hut where Ando came up with instant noodles, displays highlighting the different instant noodles around the world, and the obstacles Ando had to overcome to develop the classic. The “Interactive Cup Noodle Theatre” is a theater shaped like a giant cup of noodles which shows a video about how Ando came up with the ideas for the cup noodles as well as how cup noodles are made. An English audio guide can be rented for 2,000 Yen, which allows you to listen to the videos.Perhaps the museum’s most popular attraction, though, is the workshop where you can create your own noodle cup. If you’re uncomfortable making - and eating - your own noodles, there is a noodle factory on-site where visitors can assemble their own noodle cups from pre-made ingredients.	An unlikely hit, this museum is dedicated to the inventor of instant ramen and cup noodles.
