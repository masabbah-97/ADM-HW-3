The abandoned settlement has an eerie atmosphere, with rough seas and raging winds adding a distinct air of danger.Every spring, from the Middle Ages up until 1884, fishermen descended upon the rocky earth at Selatangar. The men spent their days reaping the sea’s bounty, retiring to land to rest and store their equipment while the same turbulent waters they harvested thrashed along the nearby shore. They lived in ramshackle stone huts that looked more like caves than homes.It was a stark, dreary existence. The ocean made its fury known, and the exposed settlement was forced to endure furious winds and a harsh, often wet climate. After Iceland began industrializing in the 19th century, Selatangar, like many other fishing villages, was abandoned. Now, all that remains is a handful of crumbling stone huts scattered around the site.Modern explorers who stumble upon the rugged ruins can clearly envision the harrowing conditions those who lived within the village once faced. It’s easy to understand how the unforgiving environment gave rise to legends of ghostly hauntings. According to some, a ghost named Tanga Tomas still roams what remains of the village.	Eerie ruins of an abandoned medieval fishing village crumble atop an unforgiving stretch of earth.
