The owner of the factory, William J. Kelly, died in 1908 before the factory was up to full speed. Due to complications within his will, all of Kelly’s assets were frozen, halting all of the facilities’ operations. In 1915, railroad workers from the Central Railroad of New Jersey went on strike near Brooksbrae. To avoid any damages to the factory, a caretaker was assigned to watch over the property. One winter night, the elderly caretaker and his wife lit a fire in the stove to warm up the residence. However, they didn’t check or clean the chimney’s flue causing a massive fire, killing the couple. After the issues with Kelley’s will were resolved, the factory was sold. Due to the deaths on the property the factory was left incomplete. The area is now a popular graffiti and art spot. 	Hidden deep within New Jersey Pine Barrens is a massive graffiti wonderland.
