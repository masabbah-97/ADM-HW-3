This particular alley, which looks much as it did in the 1930’s, has been featured in films such as Pulp Fiction, Paper Moon, Live Free or Die Hard, and The Sting.The namesake of the alley is Bela Otis Kendall, a Pasadena real estate developer whose existing Old Town buildings include the Kinney Kendall Building on Colorado Boulevard, and the Auditorium on Union Street. 	A cobblestone alley with an interesting past.
