The mountain is actually an old selenite mine. It’s still deeded to the mine owners, though it’s managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  It has a brief history and synopsis of selenite and its uses. It’s possible to wander among the small selenite deposits sparkling along the edges of the small pit. It’s a fun and interesting little adventure site suitable for the whole family.	This old selenite mine is dotted with tiny crystals that make it shimmer like it's covered in glitter.
