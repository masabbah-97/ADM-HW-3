Thus in the 1930s the town installed the huge, 101-foot length of heavy-duty chain, linking one end to a colossal boulder on Pine Mountain and attaching the other end to the mountain itself. The rock is still a popular tourist attraction and even has its own informational plaque for visitors.	This boulder stays on its mountain thanks to a huge chain and on the map due to local legend.
