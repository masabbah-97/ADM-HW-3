The entrance to the underground site is known to have been underneath a local blacksmith’s residence at one time which has led to a number of theories. Among the popular speculations about the caves is that they were a place for the gentry to drink discreetly, that they were a hiding place for religious refugees, or that the space was a smuggler’s lair. The hand-carved caves were opened as of 2003 as a tourist attraction so any aspiring historic detectives are welcome to explore the caves and decide for themselves. Update as of May 2022: The site is closed indefinitely. 	This series of Scottish caves has no clear purpose other than baffling historians.
