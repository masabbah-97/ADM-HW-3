Countless canoe enthusiasts flock to the site each year to swim and embark on leisurely trips downstream. The rocky overpass also gives its name to the nearby Chauvet-Pont d’Arc Cave which contains the world’s oldest cave paintings and was made famous by the Werner Herzog documentary, “Cave of Forgotten Dreams.”    	"A natural arch carved by a river gave its name to the so-called ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams."""
