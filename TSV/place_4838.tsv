While it’s not quite as iconic as its inspiration, the red telephone box designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, this public art installation has since become one of Kingston’s most iconic landmarks, amusing locals and tourists alike.Over the years, these disused phone boxes were reportedly infested with rats and trash until they were restored. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, “Out of Order” was repainted, refurbished, and restored to its erstwhile glory, rarely failing to amuse onlookers.
