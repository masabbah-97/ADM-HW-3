The site preserves what’s left of a sprawling farm settled by the pioneering Brantner brothers 160 years ago, and hosts the oldest standing structure in the Denver area.Now called the Four Mile Historic Park, this land once served as a stagecoach stop and dance hall for travelers along the Cherokee Trail. The Four Mile House was the last stop of a series of “mile houses” along the trail before reaching Denver, named for the exact distance between the homestead and the fledgling town. There were six other mile houses: Four, Seven, Nine, Twelve, Seventeen, and Twenty.  Only Seventeen Mile house still stands.Today, the park feels like stepping back in time—or at least out into the country without ever leaving the city. The quiet grounds, rustic outbuildings, and friendly farm animals provide a unique atmosphere that will transport you to the early days of the American West.	It's easy to forget what century it is as you wander this rustic homestead.
