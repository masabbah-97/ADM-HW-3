It’s also the tallest active volcano in Europe, and visitors can see its pocked summit craters, flows of lava that have sometimes consumed houses, and towering cinder cones. However, it’s not all desolation, as there are plants and animals that live beneath the raging volcano.Mount Etna was designated an UNESCO World Heritage site in 2013. 	The world's most active stratovolcano is almost always erupting.
