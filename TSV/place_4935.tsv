An outpost building seated between the first and second bridges was once used for a scene in the film Curse of the Golden Flower.Tourism in this area is still developing, so those who stumble upon it find that this somewhat bemusing location is well worth a visit since it’s not yet swarming with tourists. If you do manage to find it, you will be treated to a ride in a glass elevator to save your legs from a healthy walk to reach the bridges. Or, if you like, you can use the steep, treacherous staircase, 1,000 steps in all.	Not one, not two, but three natural bridges remain in this captivating spot post-sinkhole.	816 Underground Nuclear Plant,Fengdu Ghost City,Fanjingshan (Mount Fanjing)	Chongqing,China	29.3161	107.7863	lioness1041	 	2013-03-14	Favorites	Slumgullion Earthflow,Looking Glass Rock,Sasso Menicante (Trembling Stone),Macquarie Island	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/three-natural-bridges
