But in 2010, one of these ancient fast-food restaurants was reopened to the public.Before disaster struck the city, Pompeii had around 150 different thermopolia, which were long bar-like restaurants where people could grab a quick meal. There were so many in the city, that most residents didnâ€™t cook for themselves, and going out to eat was the predominant food activity for the poor, or anyone who could not afford their own private kitchen.Today, a quick tour of the Thermopolium ends with a sampling of Roman food, most notably baked cheese with honey, allowing modern day patrons to gather around the deli-like counter for some ancient fast-food.	Ancient snack bar of the Roman Empire re-opened.
