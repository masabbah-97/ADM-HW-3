The highest point and survey marker is on top of one of these boulders, and several others have been adorned with plaques that tell the story of the peak’s namesake, John Nelson Davis among other histories of farming, lumbering, mining, and even just odd stories from the area. One such story regards a Lydia Shultz, the “wild child” of the mountains, who got lost in the area while looking for lost cows. She was not found until several months later, and had become feral, hiding from search parties when they approached.The floor of the observation tower is also overlaid with a metal topographical map of the area complete with arrows pointing out the local landmarks, so all around and underfoot Mount Davis provides visitors with something to look at. 	Pennsylvania's highest point is spotted with boulders which were pushed to the surface by nothing but cold.
