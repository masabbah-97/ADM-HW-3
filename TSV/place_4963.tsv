0	Hut of Refuge	places to stay	60	554	Since so many shipwrecked survivors managed to pull themselves onto Lovell’s, the first hut of refuge in the country was constructed on the George’s Island side of the island in 1787, along with another hut on the east side of the island a few years later. The huts were credited with saving many lives (supplies inside included clothing and food), and were part of the first life-saving efforts in the US and a first effort of what would become the US Coast Guard. 	Hut with supplies for shipwreck survivors.
