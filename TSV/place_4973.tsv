Soon, people from all over the country went to gaze at the giant sticky sphere. It was at about this time that the Boys Town Stamp Collectors lost interest in their pet project.The stamp ball still resides in Boys Town, at the same size it was in 1955. It’s open for any curious onlooker to view—just don’t peel off any of the stamps.	An idle pastime becomes a record holder in Boys Town, Nebraska.
