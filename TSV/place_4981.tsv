It wasn’t until 1992 when the signs were rediscovered in the museum’s storage area that the idea for the exhibit was born. These days, the city has relaxed the regulations against neon, and the historic signs are displayed in recognition of their controversial place in the Vancouver’s history.Update May 2019: Note this exhibit is located at the Vancouver Museum.	The collection of signage remembers the midcentury pushback against the new neon light.
