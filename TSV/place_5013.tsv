0	Castellfollit de la Roca	geological oddities,natural wonders,geology,nature	95	550	Castellfollit de la Roca looks like a town that was once a normal shape, then by some incredible force stretched out over a kilometer-long basalt formation. Houses are pushed precariously close to the edge of a 160-foot drop off, and wind along the cliff looking over the countryside and rivers that flank the town below. Inhabited for over 1000 years, the town’s narrow streets still carry the characteristics of its medieval origin, and the city center features ramparts that fortified the town during the civil war. Many houses and streets in the city center are also built of the dark, volcanic rock that serves as a pedestal for the town. The main street of Castellfollit winds through the entire town narrowly pressed between houses on both sides, straining to remain on the cliff face. From its peak on the layered, volcanic formation, the town offers stunning views. To both sides, the rivers Fluvià and Toronell amble by the rock face of the town through the volcanic zone of Garrotxa. To add to the drama of the landscape, the cliffs are illuminated from sunset until midnight for six months out of the year. 	Village situated on a narrow volcanic escarpment.
