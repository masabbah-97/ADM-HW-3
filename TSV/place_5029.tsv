The victims of this tumultuous time are remembered by the Memorial to the Victims of Communism.This stunning monument was unveiled in 2002, over a decade after the fall of Communism in the country. To depict the suffering felt by the victims of the regime, seven bronze figures, all naked males, can be seen descending a long staircase, looks of despair on their pitted faces. While the first figure is whole, the second has a huge tear in his torso, and the third is missing an arm and part of his face. Each successive figure in the line is missing a bit more of its anatomy as though it was torn away, until the final figure which is little more than a jagged pair of feet.In case this representation is too symbolic for visitors to fully understand, a metal strip runs down the center of the staircase, detailing the number of victims being honored. The statistics listed are as follows:Despite the numbers, the subject of Communism is continually a controversial one and the statues have not been universally welcome with a couple of the figures having been damaged by an unclaimed bombing attempt. Regardless of the outrage on both sides, the Memorial to the Victims of Communism stands as a powerful reminder of the Czech Republic’s complicated history. 	Increasingly decayed figures stand as a powerful reminder of the human costs of Czech Communism.
