He passed on February 5, 1996 while searching for injured firefighters in a three-alarm fire. The area combines a lovely grass field with a pier that offers fantastic panoramic views of the statue, Manhattan Harbor, and the Manhattan skyline. The waterfront also overlooks the Buttermilk channel, which during the 19th and 20th centuries was one of America’s busiest waterways.The park is also home to masterful pieces of street art including giant toy blocks that welcome you to Red Hook and a majestic aquatic painting by Chris Soria reminiscent of Hokusai’s “The Great Wave off Kanagawa.”The Park-and-Pier is a mostly unknown leisure spot in Brooklyn and is typically occupied by only by local picnickers, fishermen, and Red Hook boaters.	Take in a rare, face-to-face glimpse of Lady Liberty at this tucked away Red Hook park.
