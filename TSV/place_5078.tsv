Built in 1922, the space is essentially a bomb shelter, the silos having been made fireproof in order to hold the combustible grain.In 1944, after 22 years of profitless operation, the state deeded the elevator to the Port Authority. By 1965, even the Port Authority gave up on the hulk, and it was officially deactivated. In 1997, John Quadrozzi Jr., a longtime Gowanus enthusiast, bought the building.But alas, unless a market appears for large, windowless silos, the Red Hook Grain Elevator looks like it is condemned to continue its unloved life until it crumbles into the Gowanus.   	The most unloved grain elevator in Brooklyn was a “Magnificent Mistake.”	Red Hook Play Center,Red Hook Ball Fields Food Vendors,Red Hook Community Farm	80 Halleck Street,Brooklyn, New York, 11231,United States	40.6708	-74.0046	Hannah Frishberg	danaphora,ndmlosi,tylercole,Martin,Mordy,frankdoart,Rachel,TravelTourist	2013-05-13	The 30 Most Unique Backdrops For Photos And Film in New York City	Gowanus Batcave,Jekyll Island Amphitheater,Warm Springs Ghost Town,Marshall Hall	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-hook-grain-terminal
