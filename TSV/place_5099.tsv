Situated along Antique Row, the building is an expansive three-story maze, housing a truly unreal collection of antiques and over 20 small businesses. Owners Cheryl and Alan Gorsuch have curated a one-of-a-kind collection of antiquities and art, making Sanford & Son Antiques well worth a stop, or even a road trip.The building that houses this iconic marketplace began as part of a railyard, then transitioned to an auto shop. The Sanford & Son building has existed in its current iteration since 1985. The top floor is filled to the brim with antiques from around the world, including an Egyptian sarcophagus, cultural artifacts, and two immense stained glass windows.The two lower floors contain the majority of the small boutiques, which house various art galleries, vintage and up-cycled clothing sellers, tattoo parlors, and personal care companies. The bottom floor also houses artist’s suites, with an incredible two-floor library of vintage and antique texts and a grand marble staircase.
