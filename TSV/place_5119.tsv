However, volunteers are working to preserve and restore the historic cemetery, which has a quiet, rural beauty in the shadow of the rumbling A train tracks, where foliage flourishes and lizards crawl over the solemn tombstones. Update as of April 2020: The cemetery is currently closed to visitors.Update as of March 2021: The cemetery is open to visitors on Sundays from 9 am-3 pm,  but closed on all Jewish Holidays.  However, the cemetery can be viewed clearly and photographed by walking around its perimeter on Pitkin Ave. 	One of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in the city, it is now overgrown with an urban forest.	76th Street Subway Station,Greaser on a Clock,Ridgewood Reservoir	80-35 Pitkin Avenue,Queens, New York, 11417,United States	40.6783	-73.8559	Allison	 	2013-03-15	Unique Cemeteries in New York	Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery,Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan,Warstone Lane Cemetery Catacombs,Grave of W.
