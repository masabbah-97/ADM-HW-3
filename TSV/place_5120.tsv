Born of 280 tons of concrete, Forbes Island is a massive creation complete with the island look and feel created by the 120 tons of rocks and 90 tons of sand on its surface, for years it was a palm-tree topped landmark in the middle of the bay. Shortly after its creation, Forbes Island was even featured on “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.”Forbes Island is now a restaurant anchored just off Pier 39. The underwater dining room is decorated in Victorian-seagoing opulance with porthole windows peering into the murky waters. Above deck two additional dinig rooms offer views of the city, sea lions and Alcatraz along side a 40 foot lighthouse, the top of which is accessible by a beautiful spiral staircase. The lighthouse is equipped with a real vintage Fresnel lens, on loan from the US Lighthouse Society.Visitors can dine at the upscale restaurant while hearing the voices of sea lions or grab a quick island cocktail near the blackbirds that have made the palms of Forbes their home.Update August, 2017: Forbes Island has closed for good. 	Floating man-made island and upscale restaurant.
