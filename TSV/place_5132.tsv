In the rushed chaos of the ensuing weeks, looters took to the unguarded building and stole pieces of the brewing equipment and nearly everything else of value at the site. Between the looting and the damage to the building and the remaining equipment, the brewery could no longer function when the waters finally receded and production had to be contracted out to other breweries costing a number of people their jobs and moving a long time New Orleans business out of the area.The brewery has been renovated into medical offices and the brewery has been renamed to the Faubourg Brewing Company, which means neighborhood in French. 	This relatively recently abandoned brewery is a tragic reminder of the continuing effects of Hurricane Katrina.
