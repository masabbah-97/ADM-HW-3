Taking the elevator up 42 stories to the observation room you’re met with beautiful 360-degree views of the river and bay below, the nearby village of Bucksport, and the historic Fort Knox, which, built in 1844, is one of the best preserved fortifications on the New England seacoast. Some say it’s the best view in Maine.	The first bridge observation tower in the U.S. offers one of the best views of Maine.
