Pigs, donkeys, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, and sheep roam the Hackney City Farm. It might seem strange that the Hackney City Farm is located in the heart of  London, but the idea behind its establishment in 1948 was to give young people and city locals the opportunity to escape city life and experience agriculture. Since its opening, the farm has developed into an integral community resource. The farm was given a grant by the London Borough of Hackney, but the funds have steadily declined. As a grasp at independent sustainability the farm entered the commercial market, renting workspace for other charities, selling fresh produce, and selling souvenirs. The farm community works hard to provide an educational and entertaining environment for visitors, and strives to teach the skills of living a healthier lifestyle with a smaller environmental impact. 	A flourishing garden with pigs, donkeys, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, and sheep.
