It has a name, too: “Saul.” The name’s a reference to the “Breaking Bad” character Saul Goodman, spun off from the ball’s former nickname, “SG,” short for “Sticker Giant.” Officially verified by the Guinness Book of World Records, this giant ball of gummed paper truly is more than the sum of its well-over 200,000 parts. The quirky idea to create the largest sticker ball on the planet coincided with the first-ever National Sticker Day, on January 13, 2016. The day honors R. Stanton Avery, who invented self-adhesive peel-off labels in the 1930s, giving rise to the sticker as we know it today.The giant sticker ball began as a just a handful of balled up stickers, and grew and grew from there. Started by the folks at the StickerGiant labels company in Longmont, Colorado, there were plenty of leftover stickers around to feed Saul, and good thing, because it took tens of thousands of these lightweight labels to grow Saul to its record-winning weight.The ball is now located in the StickerGiant lobby, where it is constantly growing. Visitors are encouraged to add to the already considerable heft of the ball with freely available stickers.	The world's largest sticker ball weighs in at a mighty 231 pounds.
