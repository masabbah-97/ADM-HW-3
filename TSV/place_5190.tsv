The island community was originally known simply as “Llanfairpwll,” but thanks to an enterprising local tailor with an ear for the absurd, the name was extended to its current length in order to make the village an attraction.The name, which is printed on the village’s absurdly long train station sign translates from the Welsh as, “St. Mary’s Church in the hollow of white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St. Tysilio near the red cave.” However even in translation, very few people outside of the long-suffering tourist agents in the village consider the significance of the name.While the name Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is a mouthful, it is no longer the longest place name in the world as the tailor who came up with it had intended. 	This Welsh village gave itself a ridiculous name in a publicity stunt a century ahead of its time.
