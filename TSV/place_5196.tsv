The technology at the site could both detect enemy aircraft and assist anti-aircraft missiles launched from a nearby facility.Years of disuse later, the missile site is now part of a public park. People can stomp up the steel structures and enjoy the sweeping views in all directions. Not much has changed, or what’s been added is deliberately made to match the existing structures, so it still sort of feels like somewhere you’re not allowed to be.	A Cold War site complete with rusty structures, hiking trails, and beautiful views.	Rustic Canyon's Murphy Ranch,Japanese Garden at the Donald C.
