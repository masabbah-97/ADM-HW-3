Since then, the tunnels and chambers off of this giant drain and others around Melbourne have been being explored by the group despite the constant threat of flash floods, claustrophobia, and whatever giant insectile Australian fauna has made a home in the darkness. While the ANZAC drain and its attendant large chamber act as the unofficial headquarters a number of other drains have been found and explored and given mythic names such as The Maze, The God, and The Tenth Drain.The Melbourne Storm Tunnels might look like matte paintings from an urban gothic genre piece, but they are in fact quite dangerous. Despite this, parties are thrown in the damp, spacious chambers and graffiti artists regularly delve into the depths to leave their mark.
