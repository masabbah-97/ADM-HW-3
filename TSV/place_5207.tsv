0	Lithified Sand Dunes	martian landscapes,natural wonders,ecosystems,nature	97	535	Along the southern shore of Kaua’i is a short, secluded hike along seacliffs overhanging the ocean.These are sand dunes that have slowly been lithified (turned to stone) over time, and are now slowly being eroded away by the ocean. The bright yellow hue of the rock contrasts amazingly with the deep blue of the very rough nearby ocean that is popular with windsurfers.The trail starts at Kawailoa Bay, which is gentle enough for some wading and ends at another bay-type area that looks absolutely prehistoric and barely touched. It’s not hard to imagine dinosaurs roaming around the area, and it is truly a sight to behold.	A prehistoric landscape hidden in the cliffs of Maha'ulepu.
