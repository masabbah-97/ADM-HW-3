However their origin and purpose is debated. Hypotheses include that they were used as bell towers, or as protection against raids.Kilmacduagh’s round tower excels in terms of its condition, location and height. A rope ladder would be the only means of access to a door 8m above the ground. Whatever the purpose of the buildings was, the builders performed their task well; the tower survives nearly 1000 years after it was built, despite its obvious lean.Situated in the village graveyard, Kilmacduagh’s ruins are a spiritual place of contemplation and silence. The karst landscape of County Clare’s Burren provides the horizon. The limestone rock for the buildings adds to the picturesque scene, and may be the reason the ruins still stand today.	The ruins of an 800-year-old monastery boasts the tallest round tower in Ireland.
