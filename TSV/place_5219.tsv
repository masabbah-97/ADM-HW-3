Local activists took a stand, however, and cleaned up the corner in 1976 and turned it into a community outlet for theater and cultural displays. Today, it is used to host a variety of events and continues to be a beacon of community among the anonymous disconnect of Manhattan life.	This former crime corner has been turned into an eclectic community center.
