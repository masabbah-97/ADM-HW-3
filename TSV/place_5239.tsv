In 2000, it moved into a new location: a 19th-century brick building in Frederick, Maryland that was once home to a furniture maker and undertaker operation.The museum is set up as an immersive experience, with exhibits that recreate various aspects of Civil War life: day-to-day operations in an army camp, dressing wounds in the field, evacuation of the wounded soldiers, a field hospital, and a military hospital ward.Even those who are not Civil War buffs will be interested in the amputation kits and recreations of field hospitals where wounded soldiers were separated into three categories: mortally wounded, slightly wounded, and surgical cases. The museum is dedicated to demonstrating how techniques developed on the battlefields of the Civil War contributed to modern medicine.	A Civil War Museum with some notable medical antiques.
