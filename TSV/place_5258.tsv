They occur onÂ Tuesdays and Thursdays. They run from 9:30 a.m. until noon. It still has 19th-century machines used to bend frames, people handmaking keys, and entire floors dedicated to wood incubators where materials are left for months at a time. The factory is responsible for the creation of over 2,000 grand pianos annually and is the only remaining piano factory in New York.	Piano-making empire filled with 200-year-old steam machines still churning out 1,000 instruments a year.	Cassinelli Pasta,Riker-Lent-Smith Homestead,Our Lady of Mt.
