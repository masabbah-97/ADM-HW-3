Working as part of the larger Hare Krishna community facility in Culver City, California, the museum is meant to educate, inspire, and give visitors a better understanding of the Bhagavad-gita, the Indian literary classic that remains sacred to over six million people.It consists of eleven dioramas and numerous animatronics that lead visitors through the story. In each diorama, talking clay robots give their unique perspective on the Bhagavad-gita. The story concludes in the final diorama, which is filled with dancing, pipe playing, and melodic chanting. All in all, the entire guided tour takes about 45 minutes to walk through.The museum was established in 1973, when at the request of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, a group of disciples traveled to India to learn about the ancient method of clayworking. When the artists returned to the United States, they put their newfound skills to use creating these dioramas. 	Dioramas and animatronics lead you through the story of Bhagavad-gita, the Indian literary classic.
