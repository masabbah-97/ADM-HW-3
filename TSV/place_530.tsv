Built by Cassilly and his team of 20 artists, the City Museum is constructed from materials reclaimed from St. Louis and continues to have a section displaying an “ever-expanding collection of architectural relics.” Don’t miss the ten-story spiral slide that starts at the roof and takes you all the way down to the entrance of the enchanted cave.	Less a museum than a bizarre fantasy world created by artists and engineers.
