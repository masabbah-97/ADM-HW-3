Reames believes that his living arborsculptures can replace many of the things that trees are typically killed to make.Gazebos, tables, chairs, spiral staircases, benches, entrance arches, bridges and fences represent just a small portion of Reames’s imaginative vision of a world built entirely of living trees. He is currently growing a living tree house 15 feet off the ground. He has spelled out love in apple trees. Author of two books on the subject, Reames teaches and lectures worldwide. http://www.arborsmith.com Normally private Arborsmith Studio will open on April 23rd  2022 1 P.M. To 6 P.M.  showing visitors the trees and describing the techniques he uses to create living sculpture out of trees.	A botanic garden full of trees twisted into fantastic shapes and positions.
