It’s frequently called the “Jade Museum” because it’s filled with life-sized jade animals and intricately carved objects made from jade and other semi-precious stones.The artwork belongs to the Belz family, who opened the museum to the public in 1998 to display their collection, the majority of which items created during the rule of China’s Qing Dynasty (which spanned from 1644 to 1911). Even most locals don’t realize the museum exists, making for a very quiet and personal visit with the art. The gallery spans 24,000 square feet and consists of five permanent exhibit galleries: three Asian, one Judaic, and the Holocaust Memorial Gallery.Of particular interest is a jade bridal carriage that’s large enough to carry a person or two. In addition, several large animals crafted from jade, tigers eye, ivory, and other precious stones make up a caravan in one of the galleries that is well worth seeing. In another room, a carved ivory pagoda reaches to the ceiling and is filled with tiny figures that represent fabled wise men.In addition to these exhibits, a Chinese puppet collection, carved gem flowers, carved tusks with ivory scenes, Chinese puzzle balls, and a variety of paintings, cloisonne, furniture, large vases, textiles, and other art make a visit to the Belz Museum worth the time for anyone interested in Chinese art or art crafted from precious stones.The Judaic gallery holds more than 200 pieces of contemporary Judaic art crafted by Israeli artists. It includes a set of large bronze friezes depicting Biblical scenes. The Belz family commissioned many of the pieces from artists they know personally.	"The ""Jade Museum"" is full of thousands of intricately carved works of art made from various precious stones."
