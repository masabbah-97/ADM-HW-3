They have made it the secret hide-out for the “Old Man in the Peanut,” “the Wizard of Aus(tin) ,” and the “Sage of the Leguminati, a series of carved peanuts. The artwork is the curious result of pareidolia, peanuts, and a dash of Xacto knife carving. The Bottle House is currently the only place in the world to see such peanut carvings.Update October 2018: Call the number you will be told the old owner of the property is deceased and tours are no longer given. The house is no longer maintained or repaired and is beginning to fall apart.	Unusual house, in an unusual neighborhood, home to some very unusual peanuts.
