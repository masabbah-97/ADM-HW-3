One tower is metal and holds communication equipment, with the state high point survey marker right underneath it. The other tower is a wooden construct that can be climbed for wide views of the surrounding woodlands and lakes as well as some spectacular fall foliage. The trail leading to the summit also connects the elevation to the Ice Age Trail which winds 1,200 miles through the entire state.Nearby is High Point Village Resort with picnic facilities, and the Hill of Beans coffee shop. The owners of the shop, Lyle and Kathy Blomberg, curate Timms Hill County Park and have welcomed visitors from across the globe to their small, but record-setting Wisconsin hill.	The highest point in Wisconsin is capped by two towers that are not as mythic as Tolkien's but provide much better views.
