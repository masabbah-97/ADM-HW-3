With the establishment of the Route 66 highway nearby, the formerly isolated volcano (now long extinct) began attracting droves of tourists looking to set foot in the crater and know that they had walked inside a real volcano. Amboy Crater was the only dead volcano along the entire route and as such, garnered near constant attention.As other highways were finished and Route 66’s singular popularity faded, the Amboy Crater once again became just a lonely mountain. However, in more recent times, as roadtrippers and families are once again starting to gravitate back to the iconic road,  the Amboy Crater is once again receiving regular visitors. This crater might be cool, but it is once again becoming hot.  	This dormant volcanic crater has been converted from a roiling pit of magma to a pleasant hiking spot.
