0	The Fantastic Umbrella Factory	zoos,monuments,statues,animals	292	522	Originally opened in 1760, the Fantastic Umbrella Factory is actually found on a small farm near the coast of Rhode Island and began as a plant nursery, petting zoo, and gift bazaar.Today, the Umbrella Factory is a favorite among Rhode Islanders who stop by the strange, tiny farm to check out the bizarre statuary and, above all, to go shopping. Comprising a series of old barns, the Umbrella Factory bazaar sells international goods including blown glass, Halloween costumes, and organic foods, all created locally by farmers and artists around the property.Since opening, the Umbrella Factory has also gained local renown for its plant baskets. Known for its DIY vibes, the farm has survived 40 years of a bumpy economy and even a fire on the property, and has remained one of the best-hidden gems of Rhode Island.	250-year-old farm now features sculptures, a petting zoo and a hippy-bazaar.
