So popular is the fountain that much of the chocolate has been donated by large chocolate companies such as Nestle and Guittard. The falls pump over 3000 pounds of molten chocolate down the 20-foot installation at any given time, although visitors are not allowed to swim.Please note that the store does not allow people to drink from the waterfall nor sell chocolate from this waterfall. It is for display only. 	While not recognized by Guinness, this chocolate waterfall is likely to be the world's largest.
