When CEO Jon Karlung secured a former nuclear bunker below 100 feet of Stockholm bedrock as the site for a data center, he thought it would be appropriate to bring his love of 1970s sci-fi to the design of the place.Pionen (taken from its Cold War code name) is a server housing center that can withstand a hydrogen bomb. If the power goes out, back-up is provided by a couple of German submarine engines. False waterfalls, indoor jungle plants, low-lying fog, and a conference room with an image of the moon’s surface on the floor complete the desired effect of super villain dream pad.	The internet as provided by a James Bond villain.
