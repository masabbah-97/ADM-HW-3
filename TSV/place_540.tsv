The store’s extensive catalogue consists of a vast array of books and magazines, continually replenished through a system of in-person and mail-in donations, helped along by local city regulations against book donations to public libraries. A few simple tenets form The Book Thing’s only hard and fast rules: visitors are firmly forbidden for paying for any book, even when offered; let browsers choose whatever book they want; and reselling of books is a big no-no. Anyone and everyone is invited to stop by, peruse at his or her leisure, and leave with “up to 150,000 volumes per day, per person.”Update October 2017: The Book Thing was temporarily closed after a fire, but it’s back open!	This free, take-a-book shop seems like a trick but isn't.
