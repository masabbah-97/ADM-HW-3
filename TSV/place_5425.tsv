Several critically acclaimed films were shot on location here, ranging from Terminator 2: Judgment Day to Grease. All included memorable scenes shot along this iconic riverbed. Even the 1930’s war film, All Quiet On The Western Front, used the river as a way to depict the carnage and destitute of trench warfare during World War I. 	An iconic location along the Los Angeles River where countless movie scenes are filmed.
