At the foot of the bridge stand 18 giant pottery vases, placed in a circle mimicking Stonehenge.Thanks to its uniquely bountiful clay deposits, Zanesville was once the pottery capital of the United States. The “Clay City” was home of many prized pottery companies, including Weller Pottery, which employed 1,500 workers, making it Zanesville’s largest employer. Many Weller Pottery works are valuable collectibles today.In an ode to its artisanal history, the city hosts an annual pottery festival, and was once home to the world’s largest vase. And then there’s “Vasehenge” (the nickname was given by locals).As part of a community project in the mid-2000s, 100 oversized Weller Pottery-inspired vases were created by a group of artists. Each vase stands taller than the average human, and is painted with a different themed design. About a dozen of the vases were arranged in a circle at the foot of the Y-Bridge, while more vases can be found throughout the city.Update: The vases are no longer there.
