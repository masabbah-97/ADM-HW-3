Union Park was the hub of the area’s social life in the early 1900s, with pools, fountains, dance halls, band pavilions, a cave, and a wooden roller coaster, all illuminated by this modern invention.The park changed owners a few times in the late 1800s, eventually falling into the hands of General Electric. The company spent the next 10 years turning the park into a beloved attraction showcasing the wonders of electric light. It built the roller coaster, added electric lights to the cave, and added the Mammoth Theater and pools. The park flourished.In 1919, a storm and flood hit the area, killing several people and destroying much of the park’s infrastructure. It opened back up soon after, but its popularity diminished. A dance pavilion was built using the floor of the Mammoth Theater, and an Olympic-sized pool was added in 1923, but attendance never picked back up. Union Park limped on until finally closing in 1934.Now only traces of its former glory are still visible: The overgrown remains of the theater walls, some paths and stairs, and the swimming pool foundation. The area is now a zip-line course owned and operated by the YMCA.	The remains of a bustling turn-of-the-century park built to showcase the wonders of electricity.
