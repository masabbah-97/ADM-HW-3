One stamp featured the King horse from the Kiddieland carousel ride at Cedar Point amusement park. To celebrate the release, some local Sandusky residents decided to use the vacant Sandusky Post Office to showcase, what is considered, one of rarest carousel figures. Inside, a display was created for the horse and other merry-go-round figures. Only a few hundred people were expected to attend, however, well over 2000 visitors from across the country stopped by the exhibit.After the extravaganza, a non-profit was formed to celebrate and preserve the history of carousels. The non-profit brought the former post office building and opened the museum officially in 1990. In addition to the collection of carousels, the museum also features a woodcarving shop where volunteer woodcarvers craft new carousel figurines and restore the neglected. You can also ride the museum’s own historic carousel.	Learn about the history and craftsmanship of carousels inside this museum located in a former post office.	Plum Brook Station (Neil A.
