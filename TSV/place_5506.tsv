0	Carsten Höller Slide	lost wonders,outsider art,art,museums	61	513	Update: The slide was removed once the exhibition was over.Crowds at big museums can be completely overwhelming. Wading through people on the way to the exit, feeling hundreds of bodies pushing onward is enough to make someone crazy. It must have made German artist Carsten Höller crazy too, and his new exhibition in the New Museum in New York seeks to create an alternate transportation through crowded galleries.Known for creating works that challenge patrons and wrap them into his art, Höller recently installed a three-story slide in the New Museum. Similar to his test slide at the Tate Modern in London, the exhibition is a spiraling 102-foot slide that lets visitors glide freely from the fourth to the second floor of the museum. Along with the slide that cuts through the center of the whitewashed museum in sleek silver fashion, the museum will also house a number of other works by the artist dubbed the Carsten Höller: Experience. Aimed at stimulating the senses of museum-goers, each floor of the Experience invites viewers to lose themselves in a sensory deprivation tank, a bizarre merry-go-round and of course Höller’s giant plastic slide.
