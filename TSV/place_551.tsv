The pond is surrounded by stone lanterns and lush plants native to Japan. A small bridge crosses over the water, while shoals of colorful koi carp swim below. Lurking around the vegetation in search of insects is a beautiful flock of (fairly tame) peacocks.The garden’s Japanese maple trees are particularly visually striking during the autumn months, when their leaves turn a rich golden red color casting the garden in crimson hues. And in springtime, the Sakura trees’ cherry blossoms bloom exuberantly with thousands of pink petals.	A little slice of Japan and its aesthetics in London's Holland Park.
