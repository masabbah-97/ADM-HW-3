In the 1960s, their art deco ice cream shop was decorated with black marble floors, a traditional soda fountain, all completed with a big candy counter. The shop was located directly in front of the factory and was a popular destination for families. The shop and brand remained a family-run business until the early 1990s when Dreyer’s purchased the Snelgrove brand. The giant ice cream cone was such an iconic landmark in the state that when the 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, the cone was featured on the Olympic pin.	This giant ice cream cone is the last remaining icon of a Salt Lake City staple.
