Despite its seasonal origin the shining novelty quickly became a huge hit with locals and it was decided that the star would be illuminated all year round. The star, which stands over 88 feet tall, can be seen for miles around when it is lit up, and the city of Roanoke at the foot of the mountain soon earned its colorful nickname.The giant decoration actually consists of three stars nested within each other with each concentric layer able to light up in one of America’s three patriotic hues. Today the star is lit up each night until midnight, usually shining with the red, white, and blue. However the lights of the star have been used to signal significant events over the years as well, often shining pure white to honor tragedies ranging from local car wrecks to massacres elsewhere in the state. 	Forget Hollywood, one of the biggest stars in the world can be found in Roanoke, Virginia.
