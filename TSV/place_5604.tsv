There are so many obscure treasures scattered about that visitors scarcely know where to turn first. In one corner, you can find an electroshock apparatus that might have harmed more patients than it cured. One another rack, a magic lantern complete with hand-painted slides. Several extraordinary machines are so old and obscure that they are quasi-unidentifiable. Chances are, if you’re surprised by the way something looks, you’ll be stunned by what it was used for.So don’t be shy; ask François – he’s there every day. You’ll learn a lot, and you might even walk out with a respect for progress and the onward march of scientific positivism.	A charming flea market shop dedicated to retrofuturistic apparati.
