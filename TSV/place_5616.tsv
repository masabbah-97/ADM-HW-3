It is beautiful all year round, but particularly so in spring and autumn, when there are Cherry Blossoms, Bluebells, Daffodils, and lovely hues of red and yellow.The main section features a rock garden, roses, a scented walkway and a hidden tree sculpture, as well as a temple to the goddess Minerva that’s surrounded by a stream, and pond framed by pink petals. Across the road there is a less visited section called the Great Dell, an old stone quarry that was transformed into a ornamental garden and became part of the Botanical Gardens in 1987. It feels a bit like discovering Narnia, with its lush greenland, beautiful red trees and trickling stream. You can walk among the treetops using the walkway, and uncover hidden statues dedicated to the god Jupiter and the playwright William Shakespeare. 	With lush plants and flowers, huge trees, ponds, and hidden monuments, this place feels a bit like discovering Narnia.
