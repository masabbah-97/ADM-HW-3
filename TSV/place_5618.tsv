The nearby Route 66 Fanning Outpost commissioned the massive piece of furniture as a roadside attraction in the grand American tradition. The chair stands over 42 feet tall and is crafted out of welded steel, emblazoned with the logo for the Outpost across the chair back.When it was first created, the giant rocker was actually able to sway back and forth as though it was just sitting on some Southern porch. While this was a requirement to achieve the world record, the behemoth was terrifying in motion and had to be securely welded to the ground.The World’s Largest Rocking Chair is not open for people to actually sit in save for one day a year, known obviously as “Picture on Rocker Day,” when a lift is hired to raise people up onto the seat.    	The world's second largest rocking chair is found on Route 66 in Cuba... Missouri.
