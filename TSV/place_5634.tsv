That same year, the penitentiary was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.A museum has been built and tours are offered through the Idaho State Historical Society. One of the most popular displays at the museum is an impressive collection of historic arms and military memorabilia dating back to 3500 BCE.	Jail from the 19th century that was built by inmates.
