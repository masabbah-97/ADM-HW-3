The village was conveniently located on two railways, which brought many visitors and tourists.As time distanced the residents of Zoar from the reasons for its initial founding, Zoarites became less attached to their communal ways, and voted to abandon them in 1898. To this day, though, it maintains its old world charm for tourists. Many of the German-style buildings have been restored as museums, and the historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Among the interesting things to see in Zoar, which include an art museum and a large Georgian mansion called the “King’s Palace,” one of the highlights is the Zoar Garden and Greenhouse, a large garden in the center of town with trees representing Jesus Christ and the Apostles. It dates back to the town’s founding, and is said to be based on the Book of Revelation in the Bible. 	Ohio's 19th-century communist micro-society.
