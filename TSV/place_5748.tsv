Step into the garden and the slanted House of Mystery—see and experiment for yourself! The one-hour tour is given by one of the owners but you’ll also have time to explore the mysteries and anomalies on your own.	A classic mystery spot complete with spots that are said to make you shrink or grow when you stand on them.
