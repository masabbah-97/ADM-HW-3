The restaurant was comprised of five floors, complete with a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. It was conceived by Chaves Costa. However, it only existed as a restaurant for two years and is now a municipal viewpoint.It was decorated with a ceramic panel by Manuela Madureira, a mural painted by Luís Dourdil, a tile panel by Manuela Ribeiro Soares, and a granite bas relief made by Maria Teresa Quirino da Fonseca. All are still visible. The building was abandoned in 2001 after serving as a restaurant, storehouse, and nightclub. It reopened in 2017 as a viewpoint. There are also some events held at the Restaurante Panorâmico de Monsanto such as the Iminente Festival. Inside is also filled with tons of graffiti and other forms of art. The building is truly magical. 	This now abandoned restaurant provides some of the most amazing views of Lisboa.
