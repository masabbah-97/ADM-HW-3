The animals are spread over a series of large enclosures (the largest is over nine acres), so the animals can avoid being seen by the public if they want to. That said, they have all been raised by humans and are almost always out by the fence happy to see who is visiting them.The center also holds several events throughout the year, such as “wolves and watermelons” and a chance to go inside with the arctic foxes in winter to take pictures.The center is run by volunteers, and all money raised goes toward caring for the animals. Wolf mountain is also part of a larger nationwide breeding program and sometimes will trade puppies with other facilities, most recently with Wolf Park in Indiana.
