He originally opened a general grocery store at the location, but after talking with locals about Bigfoot sightings in the area, he decided to convert his store into what it is today.When visitors first walk into the outpost, they are immediately greeted by a large Sasquatch statue. The store is filled with novelty items such as t-shirts, patches, and socks that feature the legendary creature.Inside has a magical forest vibe and is decorated with trees and twinkling lights. There is a small cave for children to walk through and see a tiny Sasquatch sleeping. They also sell a variety of accessories and offer guided Bigfoot themed expeditions. There are also plenty of signs and photos of Sasquatch, along with a map of Colorado where Sasquatch has been sighted and a variety of footprints. This small museum is a fun spot to visit whether you’re a believer or a skeptic. 	A museum dedicated to the mysterious cryptid.
