In the 2nd century CE, Simena was hit by a series of violent earthquakes and sank beneath the waves.Today it is still possible to see the city ruins, clearly visible just a few meters below the clear waters of the Mediterranean. The ruins of Simena include a shipyard, foundations of public buildings,houses, and a couple of amphorae. Above the shoreline, further houses, a few Lycian tombs with their distinctive arched roofs, and the remains of an early church are visible. A stone staircase can also still be found descending into the calm waters.Kekova Island, where the ruins are located, is now uninhabited, although a few goats can be spotted grazing among the ruins. Occasionally a villager rows across to harvest the wild thyme (“kekik”) that gives the island its name. In 1990 the Turkish government declared Kekova Island and the surrounding region to be a Specially Protected Area, preserving it from further development. UNESCO also lists it as a “tentative” candidate for World Heritage status.Swimming, snorkeling, diving, and jet-skis are forbidden in the area around the sunken city; however, chartered boats are permitted to cruise above it at a slow pace, affording a good view of the ruins both above and below the waterline.	Hidden just under the waters around this Turkish island are the ruins of a once great city.
