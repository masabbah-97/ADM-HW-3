The water is vibrant blue, unpolluted, and pure. They can reach a depth of up to 25-feet, making them a fun stop for amateur scuba divers. Some even claim that there are underwater tunnels between two of the pools.	This set of three large, volcanic hot springs is a favorite haunt for intrepid divers.
