0	Birnam Oak and Sycamore	shakespeare,trees,plants	112	490	These iconic trees lie in a wooded valley by the River Tay in the Scottish village of Birnam. They are thought to be the sole surviving trees from the ancient Birnam Wood that once covered the banks of the river and which was immortalized in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. In his tragic play of murder and revenge, the three witches prophesize that Macbeth “shall never vanquish’d be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill shall come against him.” The prophecy comes true when Macbeth’s enemies camouflage themselves with parts of the trees of the wood and then march on his forces. Shakespeare is believed to have traveled to Birnam in 1599 whilst part of a troupe of touring actors.The oak is now hollow up to a height of 10 meters, with several of its branches supported by crutches. Both trees appear on the list of Scottish Heritage Trees.	"Macbeth's infamous ""Great Birnam Wood."""
