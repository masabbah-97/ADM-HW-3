Since then, it’s hosted such installations as Christo’s massive inflatable “Big Air Package” in 2013.While its role as an art space is important, the Gasometer represents the peak of technology associated with coal/gas storage. It has the classic shape of a tar sealed gasholder. A piston, built into the gasometer would move within a cylinder allowing the volume stored to increase, while maintaining only a small positive pressure. This is controlled by a seal of viscous coal tar between the cylinder and piston.These types of devices are now antiques, as those that function are almost inclusively tied to furnace complexes. The re-purposing of the area as an art space will ensure that this important relic of coal carbonization is maintained for posterity.	An industrial relic is now one of Europe's most staggering art spaces.
