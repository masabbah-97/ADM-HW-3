While you watch the action in the mine, a descriptive narration recorded in several languages explains the operations.From the overlook, you can watch 240 and 320 ton capacity haulage trucks deliver copper ore to the in-pit crusher, where the material is reduced to the size of soccer balls before being loaded onto a five-mile conveyor that carries the ore to the Copperton Concentrator. Some curious facts about the mine include:*Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine has produced more copper than any mine in history—about 18.1 million tons.*The mine is 2-3/4 miles across at the top and 3/4 of a mile deep. You could stack two Sears Towers (now known as the Willis Building) on top of each other and still not reach the top of the mine.*The mine is so big, it can be seen by the space shuttle astronauts as they pass over the United States.*If you stretched out all the roads in the open pit mine, you’d have 500 miles of roadway—enough to reach from Salt Lake City to Denver.Update: As of summer 2019, the visitors center and organized tours are back fully operational.
