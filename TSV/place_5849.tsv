Whiteford Lighthouse is unique in its survival as the only wave-swept cast-iron lighthouse in British coastal waters, and deeply significant to the history of cast-iron architecture. It holds the status of a Scheduled Ancient Monument.	This lonely cast-iron structure is the only wave-washed lighthouse of its kind left in all of Britain.
