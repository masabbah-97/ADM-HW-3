0	The New York New Church	occult,churches,sacred spaces	58	487	Remain relaxed, and center your thoughts. Focus on the candle, dimly lighting the room, and begin your experience. There is no telling what kind of experience you will have, but an open mind will certainly take you further in the New York New Church. An institution based on the teachings of Christian mystic, Emmanuel Swedenborg, the possibility of a supernatural experience is enough to pull many visitors to each ceremony.Of course, this is not without reason. Swedenborg, along with being a Christian reformer, was well-known for his mid 18th-century psychic visions. One of these visions even correctly predicted a fire in Stockholm, that spared Swedenborg’s house. Coincidence or crazy, entering the church and participating in a seance may be the only way to find out.	Join in a Seance at the Swedenborgian Church.
