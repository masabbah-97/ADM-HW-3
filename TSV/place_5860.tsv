0	Nathan Manilow Sculpture Park	sculpture gardens,universities,sculptures,art	103	486	It’s certainly not small, but this sculpture park is definitely still a hidden treasure. Spread over 100 acres of sprawling prairie land, the space is filled with enormous, eye-catching work by some of art history’s greats.Currently, 29 large-scale pieces by artists like Mark di Suvero, John Henry, Martin Puryear, Richard Hunt, Christine Tarkowski, and Mary Miss dot the landscape. You can find sculptures created by late-20th century American sculptures, artists based in the Chicago area, and artists from abroad.A lot of the sculptures are abstract, and many are related to the natural landscape. A huge, slumped-over, Paul Bunyon-like figure is easily recognizable among the more interpretive shapes. The Martin Puryear piece Bodark Arc is an amazing land art piece that is unique in this important artist’s career.Four of the sculptures were donated by the founder, Lewis Manilow, who with his father Nathan redeveloped University Park, a suburb then known as Forest Park South. The younger Manilow also helped found the Museum of Contemporary Art and was instrumental in the relocation of the Goodman Theater and the renovation of the Oriental and Palace theaters, all in Chicago. Wandering around the park, which basically feels like a giant open-air museum, is a leisurely experience. The paths are mostly grass so the park is ideal for an outdoor, artistic adventure in nature.	A sprawling museum filled with larger-than-life works of art.
