Working as the portrait holographer for New York’s (now closed) Museum of Holography for years, Sapan has had a slew of celebrity commissions; Andy Warhol, Bill Clinton, and Isaac Asimov are amongst the impressive list who have posed to have Sapan’s holograms made in their likeness. Today many of these celebrity portraits are on display within the holography gallery, along with the world’s largest collection of motion image holograms, cylindrical, multi-channel and computer generated holograms, novelty items and stickers.Sapan is passionate about his craft and loves discussing the science of laser physics with visitors as well as showing off his work. The very lucky tourist may just get a special invitation to experience where all the holography magic occurs: beneath the shop in Sapan’s basement laboratory, a sci-fi lover’s dreamworld of labyrinthine passageways and beaming streams of laser light.	The world's oldest hologram gallery and the labyrinthine laser laboratory of a holography pioneer.	Rose Hill Historic House,Chester A.
