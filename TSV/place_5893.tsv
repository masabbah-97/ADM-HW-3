The agreement between Seltice and Post was painted on what has since become known as “treaty rock” (historians are unclear if it was done as a record of the contract or in a later commemoration). According to one source, Post Falls’ treaty rock may be the only place in the United States where a compact with a Native tribe was signed on rock. The inscription on Treaty Rock is protected from vandals by a sheet of plexiglass. In 2012 three interpretive signs were placed at the site of the rock to tell the story of the Seltice-Post agreement.	A wild west land agreement was etched right onto this historic Idaho stone.
