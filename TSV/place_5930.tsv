The metallic dragon was modeled on one from the Ly Dynasty and is illuminated with 2,500 LED lights.Watching it shoot fire might seem a bit terrifying for the six lanes of traffic that drive beneath the mythical giant, but it can also playfully spray water from its mouth. 	This bridge is embedded with a giant steel dragon that breathes fire from its mouth.
