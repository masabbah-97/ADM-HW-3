He considers himself as a champion of the arts scene, but has been accused of shady practices, ranging from bad maintenance to spying on tenants—a charge alluded to by his failed plan to mount enormous video screens and cameras overlooking the “Six Corners”.	Not to be confused with the iconic New York City skyscraper, this Chicago building is a vibrant hub for artists.
