Hordes of pink flowers burst from branches that stretch over the streets, creating enchanting cherry blossom tunnels.The springtime spectacle takes place in the Altstadt (Old Town) of Bonn, Germany. With its narrow cobblestone streets and picturesque buildings, this part of the city is charming enough even without the grand floral display. The thousands of cherry trees lining the alleys add an extra dash of whimsical beauty.The cherry trees, which are native to Japan, were planted in Bonn in 1980. Their bunches of pink flowers have unfurled over Bonn’s streets yearly ever since. As the weeks wear on, the blossoms begin fluttering toward the earth, eventually carpeting the sidewalks and streets beneath layers of delicate petals.Locals and visitors alike delight in this gorgeous annual display of nature’s beauty. Don’t be surprised to see cyclists whizzing beneath through the tunnels alongside lovestruck couples taking a romanic stroll beneath a canopy of flowers.
