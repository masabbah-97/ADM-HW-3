The more than 2,600 cookie containers at Grannie’s Cookie Jars & Ice Cream Parlor are part of a collection that Edith Eva Fuchs has been amassing since 1988.Customers can peruse the shelves of jars shaped like everything from Bugs Bunny and Wonder Woman to fruit baskets, cows, and the Titanic as they enjoy ice cream in homemade waffle cones (each of which has a Hershey’s Kiss waiting at the bottom). If there was a favorite jar from your childhood you just may see it here. As for Fuchs? She told the Guinness Book of World Records that her favorite is a jar shaped like Roy Rogers riding his horse, Trigger.
