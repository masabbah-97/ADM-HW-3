On the outside, the building blends in perfectly with the monotony of the surrounding buildings. However, one step inside reveals a building hiding an interesting and mesmerizing interior. Inventionland is a 60,000 square foot invention factory that has been helping people turn their ideas into reality since 2006. As a creative-immersive workplace, Inventionland has walkways lined with grass and chirping birds. Employees may find their workspace nestled inside a castle on the deck of a pirate ship. 	A unique workspace where offices reside on pirate ships and inside gingerbread houses.
