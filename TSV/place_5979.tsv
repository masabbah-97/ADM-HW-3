As less than 100 of these plastic, prefabricated UFO-shaped houses were ever made from Finnish architect Matti Suuronen’s famous futuristic design, this is a rare architectural treat. Among the few Futuro houses still standing today, this is one of the most easily accessible examples. Don’t miss it when visiting any of the Pinakotheks, or take a 10-minute walk from the Residenz.	One of the most easily accessible examples of the rare 1960s UFO houses.
