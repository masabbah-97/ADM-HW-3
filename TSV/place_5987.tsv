Originally made of wood and bamboo, the noisy sculpture is now entirely made of metal. The harp works by being spun as the wind passes through its many threads, creating a variety of musical tones depending on the weather. The historic harp now stands behind a nursing home, playing music and singing the history of Solvang.	California's oldest wind harp represents a historic piece of America's Danish history.
