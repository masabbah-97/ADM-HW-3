0	The Neon Museum	neon,signs,museums	60	476	Somehow, neon signs are both opulent and decadent, romantic and depraved. And, like murals and high-rises, they tell the story of a city.That’s the idea, anyway, behind the Neon Museum of Philadelphia, the new emporium of forgotten signs located within the makerspace warehouse NextFab. Many of the displays—among them local legends like Pat’s Steaks, Bookbinder’s, and McGillin’s Olde Ale House—point to a more colorful bygone era in the City of Brotherly Love.The museum also features displays from national commercial brands like Sherwin-Williams and GE, and even some neon folk art from the likes of John Tanaka, Val Maddalo, and museum founder Len Davidson.There are about 130 decommissioned, non-restored neon signs at the museum.	Old neon signs from the City of Brotherly Love provide a snapshot of the city’s evolution.
