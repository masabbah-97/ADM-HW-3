The 18-hole course feels, smells, and looks like a real cave. It’s the ideal destination for those wanting to experience the subterranean world, but are unable to venture through the caverns.There’s plenty to learn during your experience aside from improving your short game. Each hole provides educational tidbits, highlighting the various aspects of the caverns. 	A miniature golf course crafted inside the world's largest simulated cave.
