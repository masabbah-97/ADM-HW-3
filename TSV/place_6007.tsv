Most dolmens were built around 3000 BC, and despite their being widely accepted to be burial sites there is little concrete evidence to identify them as actual tombs. Whatever the site’s true purpose, the Kilmogue tomb’s massive standing stones remain as a site that inspires awe in most visitors. 	Huge standing stones mark a site of megalithic mystery.
