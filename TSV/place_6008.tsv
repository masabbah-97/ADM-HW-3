After her death she was rumored to have been buried atop Knocknarea. While the story of Medb’s burial is strictly legend, the massive cairn on top of the hill is very real. Unfortunately, while researchers have found a nearby depression from which most of the cairn-stones were likely quarried, no one has ever excavated the rock pile itself, so the location and identity of any body has never been discovered.	This 30-foot pile of rocks may be the grave of a mythological Irish queen.	The Glen,Grave of W. B.
