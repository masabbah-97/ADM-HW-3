He opened his current museum in 2003, moving almost 3,000 tons of tanks and equipment to the massive 330,000 square foot space, giving him the room to show off his rolling coffin collection. In addition to appreciating the engineering marvel of the large vehicles, Gasser established the museum to honor all those who died in war, specifically by tanks.The tanks in the museum hail from just about every era of warfare, ranging from World War I to Operation Desert Storm. Many of them are simply parked as though they are on display in a car collector’s garage, but still others have been placed amongst reconstructed battle scenes, complete with terrain and soldier mannequins. It may be one of the grandest presentations of just TANKS anywhere in America.Due to funding issues, the museum may not remain in its current home for much longer, but wherever it ends up, the rolling thunder will likely accompany it.      	This sprawling museum holds one man's giant collection of real tanks.
