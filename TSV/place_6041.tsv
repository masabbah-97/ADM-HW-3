It sits in front of a classic Victorian-style home and looks much like one of the neighborhood’s ubiquitous tiny libraries (from which the owners drew construction inspiration).On any given month, the gallery may hold a herd of Lilliputian dinosaur busts, tiny primates, or a collection of minuscule sparkling crystals. Everything is arranged as it would be in a typical exhibit and the tiny gallery is adorned with display cabinets, carpets, and even couches.One could pass by the shadow box without even noticing, but it’s certainly worth a look. Fully perusing the exhibit shouldn’t take too long.	A tiny art gallery in Sunnyside helps keep Portland weird.
