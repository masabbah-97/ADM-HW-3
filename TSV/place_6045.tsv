The pattern on this egg is a traditional Czech design.The project was commissioned by the City of Wilson to commemorate the area’s strong heritage. Local artist Christine Slechta, who is a talented Kraslice (what the Czechs and Slovaks call these delicate works of art) creator, chose the design and painted it along with help from the community. Every part of the egg and surrounding gazebo is Kansas made.This is a labor of love from the Kansas Czechs to the world. Anyone traveling by Wilson on I-70 is encouraged to come stretch your legs in the shade of the egg. Wilson is also only a few short miles from Wilson Lake; which has the clearest waters in Kansas, as well as some of the most beautiful scenes. The community of Wilson also hosts an annual celebration of Czech Heritage the last weekend of July every year. 	A 20-foot-tall egg painted in a traditional Czech patterns by the Czech community in Wilson, Kansas.
