There you’ll find a small, tombstone-like granite slab dedicated to Champ and “those people in Vermont who have sighted Champ and are in search of Champ.” Besides a cartoony depiction of the creature, it bears the monster’s pseudo-scientific name Belua Aquatica Champlainiensis.This lonely stone isn’t the only way that the city of Burlington has embraced its monster. Champ has been labeled as an officially protected species by the government of Vermont, and businesses often incorporate Champ into their identity, the most notable example of this being Burlington’s Minor League baseball team, the Vermont Lake Monsters.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.
