Afterwards, Revere rode out from Boston northwest towards Concord to warn of the British Army’s intent to seize a cache of arms and supplies hidden for use by the militia units in the area. This event eventually culminated in the skirmish at the Lexington town green and later the fight at Concord’s North Bridge between American militia and British Regulars, thus beginning the American Revolutionary War on April 19, 1775. The shots fired upon the British by the militiamen at the North Bridge were later immortalized in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1836 poem “Concord Hymn” as the “…shot heard round the world.”	One of two lighted lanterns hung in the church belfry on the eve of the Revolutionary War to warn that the British were on their way.
