It is a serene and magical place to watch wildlife, observe plants and to seek peace and solace. Its name is said to derive from Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” and translate to “land of the hereafter.”The bog’s is a “kettle hole pond” and was formed some 12,000 years ago when a large chunk of glacial ice broke off to form the bog. It’s a state-designated “unique natural feature” and part of the Watchable Wildlife program.There’s a 3/4-mile-long loop trail on more than 70 acres supported by primitive “bog boardwalks” that allow visitors to travel across the water and bog mat vegetation.  Stepping off the boardwalk in summer and onto the open bog mat—even where it’s vegetated—can be dangerous. A close eye should be kept on children, and pets should be left at home during the warmer seasons. 	A 12,000-year-old bog boasting rare plants and fauna.
