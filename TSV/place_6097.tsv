No matter the backstory, the village has become something of an out-of-the-way tourist destination. Grandpa Rainbow is now the only person living in the village, and despite the draw, Rainbow Family Village is currently under threat of demolition to make way for new development. 	Grandpa Rainbow felt the neighborhood needed some color, so he picked up a paintbrush and went to work.
