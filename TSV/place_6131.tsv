These ramshackle structures date as far back as the 1850s. They hail from an era when gold fever struck the region. The towns all quickly became abandoned as gold deposits dried up. The various buildings were collected by the Dave and Arvilla Mills family and were relocated to this site.The ghost town has been accessible to the public for various periods, most recently reopening in 1992. It exists in a stage of “arrested decay,” and visitors can see the various buildings housing artifacts and a few creepy mannequin stand-ins. There’s even a town jail to visit that has been rumored to be the site of paranormal activity. There are historical notices posted around the town that describe the various buildings and detail their origins. One of the buildings on the road hosts a little antique shop with some very unique finds. Admission is $5.50 for adults, $4.50 for children five to 12, kids five and under get in for free. 	This ramshackle ghost town is comprised of mining-era buildings collected from around the region.
