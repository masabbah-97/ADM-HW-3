Even well known classics such as The Ugly Duckling, The Little Mermaid, and The Emperors New Clothes can be read much deeper than a mere bedtime story. The museum focuses on his life and work. It also highlights his friendship with the famed singer Jenny Lind. He deeply loved her and wrote the story The Nightingale in her honor which later became part of her stage name. Although she did not feel the same, she was very kind to him. She remained an important muse to him and they were great friends for many years.The museum also has a collection of his paper cuttings on display. Often while telling stories he would be cutting a folded paper as one would cut a paper snowflake, and as his story went on he continued to cut more so that by the end of the story, he’d open it up to reveal a charming scene in paper lace.	Honoring the famed folktale author, this California museum looks like it belongs in the Black Forest.
