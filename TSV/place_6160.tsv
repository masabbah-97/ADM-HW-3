In 1860 a great debate over evolution was held by the Society for the Advancement of Sciences, and in 1894 the first public demonstration of telegraphy was held within the lecture theatre.Update as of July 2022: The remains of the Dodo bird are not on display.   	Home to the most complete dodo remains known - one head, and one foot.
