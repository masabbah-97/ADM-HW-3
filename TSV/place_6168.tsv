The now abandoned tunnel runs under what used to be the original Welland Canal for well over 500 feet, decreasing in height as you head east before ending in a silt-filled wetland. The structure is stone and timber, the floors are filled with mud, and there is a constant dripping sound inside the tunnel. Although there are claims the tunnel is haunted, the ghostly feeling is probably caused by the eerie dripping sounds and the visible fog of your breath, as the dark deserted tunnel is quite cold even in the heat of summer.	Abandoned for over a century, this chilling train tunnel is now a destination for ghost hunters.
