One highlight is the domed and motif-lined Wainwright Tomb, originally built for the young wife of Ellis Wainwright, brewery owner and railroad developer who also commissioned the construction of the Wainwright Building, a St. Louis landmark.The cemetery came into being in 1849, when a devastating cholera epidemic struck St. Louis, killing over 4,000. Given the rapid population growth of the area and concern that cemeteries in the city posed a health risk, the Rural Cemetery Association saw the need to purchase 138 acres of land along the road to Fort Bellefontaine. Over time, the city grew around the expanding cemetery.The final resting place of approximately 87,000 people, Bellefontaine Cemetery is not to be missed by those who like to mix their macabre musings with some high-quality urban landscaping and architecture. Many wealthy families and prominent figures in the expansion of the West are entombed here in architecturally-significant, elaborate mausoleums.Other notable burials include the victims of the 1855 Gasconade Bridge train disaster (the worst railroad disaster in Missouri history), William Clark, William S. Burroughs, The Joy of Cooking author Irma S. Rombauer, and William Beaumont, the “father of gastric physiology.”In a unique display of life and mortality in the cemetery, Bellefontaine—a Level II Accredited Arboretum—is home to three state champion trees: an American elm, shingle oak, and red mulberry. The cemetery also boasts a dwarf redwood (a mutant derived from seeds collected by one of the first groups of scientists to visit China  after it opened its borders in the 1960s) and thousands of shrubs and trees representing international and regional varieties.	The first rural cemetery west of the Mississippi is home to the elaborate tombs of St. Louis' local beer barons.
