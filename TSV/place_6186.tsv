Large handmade signs state “all snakes are protected here.”An assortment of large sculptures sit just inside the entrance. There, both rusty and expertly painted dinosaurs mingle with a giant gila monster and a Native American on horseback. Farther away, a wild stallion poses in mid-leap.The gate is often open during the day with a large welcome sign on it. 	"Rusting dinosaurs frolic at the entrance to this roadside ""snake sanctuary."""
