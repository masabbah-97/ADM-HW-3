Inside a 14th-century building known as the Saaihalle, founders Cédric and Eddy Van Belle have assembled a curious collection of artifacts, equipment, and art. Their museum traces the history of the fry, from Andean potatoes to Belgium’s iconic paper cones of crispy, hot pommes frites. There’s an Inca-era vase featuring potatoes, dioramas of Peruvian farmers and potato-peeling European soldiers, vintage ads, an extensive assortment of potato cutters, and a mobile of dangling tubers of various hues and sizes from around the world.After working up an appetite, visitors can descend to the medieval cellar, where a cafe dishes up pommes frites, among other items such as croquettes and beef stew. 	Potato-peeling mannequins, Inca art, and a dangling tuber mobile help trace the history of fries at this Belgian museum.
