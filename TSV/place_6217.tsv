Or strawberry, or orange, or tomato.The town of Konagai, in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, has fourteen yummy, fruity bus stops, originally designed and built for a 1990 expo in Osaka, 450 miles away. Travel was the expo theme, and it was hugely successful. So successful that other towns and cities jumped on the fruitcart and had expos of their own.The fruit-shaped bus shelters made their way from the original Osaka expo down to Konagai, where they helped draw crowds to the coastal town on the Ariake Sea. They’ve stayed in service there ever since, lining the main road through town, keeping travelers dry. They still look pretty good after 25 years. Hardly a brown spot on any of them.	This town near Nagasaki is peppered with fruit-flavored bus stops.
