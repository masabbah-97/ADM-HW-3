The system of terraces stretches over four counties — Yuanyang, Honghe, Jinpin, and Lvchun — although the main area is in Yuanyang. Incorporated into the terraces are 82 villages, and a farming system involving buffaloes and cattle, as well as eels, ducks, and fish. The terraces were designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. 	A complex and beautiful system of rice terraces covers a million acres over the mountains.
