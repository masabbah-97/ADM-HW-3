This rich history is on display at the museum which features over 300 banjos ranging from handmade folk instruments, to tightly calibrated concert banjos.In addition to the wall-to-wall banjo collection the museum is interspersed with historic sheet music, related ephemera, and out-of-print records from forgotten banjo greats. The museum prides itself on its collection of ornate Jazz-era banjos, but its true pride should come from devoting its existence to a musical tradition that might otherwise have been forgotten. In the small café at the front, you can even try out some banjo playing yourself.	Very likely the only museum in the world that celebrates the glory of the humble banjo.
