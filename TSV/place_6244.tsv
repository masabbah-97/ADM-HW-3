It closed in 1986, and now visitors can tour through the rusting machines of its production areas. There’s also a science center on the site called the Ferrodrom where visitors can learn about the science of making iron, and art exhibitions as well as concerts are often held in the massive power halls. 	A former ironworks that was the first UNESCO industrial site.
