0	Leslie Nielsen's Gravesite	catacombs and crypts	127	460	Leslie Nielsen wasn’t going to move on to the next world without having a little fun.So the legendary comedian’s gravesite in Ft. Lauderdale is more playful than you’re likely to find in most cemeteries.Located in picturesque Evergreen Cemetery, a witty inscription on his otherwise simple headstone reads “Let ‘er Rip,” a play on the actor’s often flatulence-inspired comedy. The gravesite is actually far less grand than one would expect of a famous Hollywood icon, but it’s not without its hidden treasures; the grave site’s bench is marked with another Nielsen-centric inscription that reads “Sit down whenever you can,” which was widely known to be his standard line of advice for actors or comedians who asked him for advice. 	A self-explanatory attraction allows fans to respectfully remember and honor a comedy legend.
