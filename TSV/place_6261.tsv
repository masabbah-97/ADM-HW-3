Bowlin even had rhinestones embedded in his dentures. He didn’t stop there, covering every inch of his house in his sparkling rhinestone art. His house, which was in Mississippi, has been moved in an effort to preserve it and now is on display at the Kohler Arts Center in Wisconsin.The John Michael Kohler Arts Center specializes in outsider artists, or environmental builders; while there be sure to check out the work of Nek Chand, Tom Every, and Sam Rodia, all wonderful outsider artists in their own right.
