The original builder actually went bankrupt a year before the project was finished, but construction could not be halted as the building already housed the remains of many bodies.Instead, new architects were hired and the originally intended Gothic architecture was stripped from the plans, leaving behind the modernist granite structure that watches over Denver today. Construction again was halted during World War II, but finally finished in the 1950s. Today, the monumental building is a historic landmark of Denver. Inside it also features a chapel with eerie red stained-glass windows, adding to the macabre atmosphere of this strange place.	A seven-story 1920s mausoleum outside Denver houses thousands of remains.
