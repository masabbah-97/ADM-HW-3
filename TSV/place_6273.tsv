Each visit can provide one with some sort of new find, each time stranger than the last. The retail store is often a destination for travelers, artists, crafts people, and awe-struck school children.“Created in 1987 by Ron Cauble, who simply wanted an excuse to learn more about Natural History…Though Ron could claim to be a professional in at least one field, he proudly affirms his amateur status with bones, insects and fossils. He asserts that ‘amateur’ is a dignified and important title. He likes to remind us that it means ‘lover’, and that the world needs more amateurs…and more lovers.”	A store that sells all manner of bones, insects, and animal curiosities.
