Even at 4,000 pounds, she takes flight a bit when the wind is strong enough, turning ever so slightly. The giant bird stands on a tall cinderblock stand on skinny little legs that belay the true weight of the fake beast.Sumner sits along a migration path that sees a large number (around 100,000) of wild geese land in the local lakes each year, attracting a number of hunters. This has earned the town its fowl nickname, along with the goose-themed festival which has been held there since 1955. There is no mistaking the town’s claim to fame thanks to a general theme of geese, of which Maxie is clearly the crown jewel.Visitors to the giant statue are welcome to try and touch the wingtips but may be hard-pressed to reach them, given that they hover a bunch of feet in the air, measuring in at around 65-feet in length. Luckily, even at its massive size, the bird comes off as more majestic than monstrous.     	"This 40-foot fowl marks the so-called ""wild goose capital of the world."""
