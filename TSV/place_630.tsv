In 1902 Rosenheim built this stately house, situated on a hill in the Country Club Park neighborhood that became known as Billionaire Row. His neighbors included some of the most influential names in California including the Kinneys and the Dohenys.Rosenheim went on to design a number of commercial and residential buildings in Los Angeles, including the Hamburger Department Store that eventually became the flagship May Company Department Store in downtown. The Rosenheim Mansion features Tiffany stained glass, Italian brickwork, and exotic wood finishes. It also has six fireplaces, a gold-leaf ceiling, solarium, semi-circular library, and an ultra-private high-end recording studio.It has been featured in numerous TV productions, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Bones, and Law & Order: SVU. In 2011 the house was chosen as the location for the first season of American Horror Story: Murder House. To better facilitate filming in the mansion, a large addition was built that was once used as a church. It is a private residence with no tours.	This grand mansion has starred in everything from Bones to Buffy.
