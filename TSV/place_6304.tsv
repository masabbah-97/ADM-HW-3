Brown see this reuse not just as an opportunity but as a responsibility, turning his environmental morals towards his artwork. The most striking piece is likely the tall “tree” made of strings of disused fishing buoys. This theme is carried over to the house as well which features more strings of buoys along the walls accented by signs, life preservers, and assorted other artfully placed pieces. There is even an out of commission helicopter on the grounds which is also covered in netting and painted a bright orange. Visitors and passersby will likely remember Hong Kong Willie for its cacophonous art pieces but locals generally seem to know the shop more for having the best composting worms around.   	Recycled junk and fishing buoys litter the yard and facade of this bait shop cum art project.
