There isn’t much else to see along this stretch on Detroit’s east end. The building was a popular ice cream parlor in the 1950s. Long after it closed, it received a jolt of publicity in 2002, when it was featured in the movie 8 Mile. The filmmakers gave the decrepit building a fresh coat of paint, but since production wrapped it has remained untouched and on the market since 2016. 	Standing guard on top of an old, vacant ice cream shop.
