For a few weeks in springtime, the woodland floor blooms with millions of bluebell flowers, carpeting the forest with vibrant blue and purple hues. This stunning phenomenon is a feast for the eyes. The contrast of colorful flowers blanketing the ground below the tall green trees is a sight quite unlike anything else. There are miles of walking trails to follow through this flowery sea, where you can take in the atmosphere and snap some photos. The 5,000-acre Ashridge Estate in the Chilterns Hills is known as one of the best places in England to see bluebells in flower, and visitors come from far and wide to experience this wonderful scene. The flowers themselves are a protected species, so if you do visit the woods, be sure to stick to the footpaths. 	Each spring this woodland floor is carpeted with purplish flowers as far as the eye can see.
