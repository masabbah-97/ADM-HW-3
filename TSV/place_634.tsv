The interior of the “ship” holds the massive play place which is similarly space-themed, complete with the mascots in space suits. While there are a handful of McDonald’s around the world that go out of their way to fit in to their community despite the overwhelming influence of corporate conformity, few take it quite to this extent. However, in a city where everything (even street lamps and mail boxes) is inspired by tales of the Roswell Incident, the McDonald’s, as is their wont, fits right in. 	This fast-food outlet is the only space and UFO-themed McDonalds in the world.
