Although most of the headstones with inscriptions like “Darling Dolly – my sunbeam, my consolation, my joy” and “Prince. He asked for so little and gave so much” to the touching “In memory of our darling little Bobbit. When our lonely lives are over and our spirits from this earth shall roam, we hope he’ll be there waiting to give us a welcome home” show testimony for the Victorians’ love for their dogs and cats. There are also at least three monkeys and several birds remembered here as well. The cemetery sits inside Hyde Park’s 350 acres – which have been open to the public as parklands since 1637 –  tucked away by the gatekeeper’s cottage. Today the cemetery is managed by the Royal Parks, and is only visible through fences unless a special visit is arranged.	The final resting place to 300 Victorian-era pets hides inside the city park.
