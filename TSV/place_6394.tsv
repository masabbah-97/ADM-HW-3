The park is well-kept and beautiful all year round.In the middle of the garden lies a greenhouse, a true Valhalla for cactus and succulent lovers. One of the paths will lead you to a cute teahouse, where you can sit down with a nice cup of tea or coffee and enjoy one of their delicious muffins before you continue your green adventure.
