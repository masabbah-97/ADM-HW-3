And that’s about it.The charming chapel was dedicated in October 1962, when Seattle was hosting the World’s Fair. It has seen some surface changes, but remains much the same as it did then.It is a favorite with locals, some of whom have even gotten married or renewed their vows in the tiny wayside chapel. 	The tiny church offers succor to travelers driving by, but only eight at a time.
