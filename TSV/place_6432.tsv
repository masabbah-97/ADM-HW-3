Many feature intricate interlaced designs and take the form of crosses or crossed shafts. There are also 5 huge hogback stones, massive monolithic blocks carved to resemble the backs of boars or hogs. There is also a sarcophagus which was suspected to have contained artifacts belonging to King Constantine, who was considered to be a saint.In March 2019, a 14-year-old student named Mark McGettigan found three more stones while volunteering on an archaeological dig. This brings the total of stones owned by the Church to 34. 	Early Medieval stones sit on display at the beautiful Govan Old Church in Glasgow.
