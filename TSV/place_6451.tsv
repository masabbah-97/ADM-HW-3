It was installed by the University of Leiden by pioneer botanist and Flemish doctor Carolus Clusius, whose original garden behind the academy building contained over 1,000 different plant species and introduced several new specimen via the Dutch East India Company, including the much-loved tulip. Today, more than 10,000 species from all over the world reside in the garden’s various beds and greenhouses, including a significant carnivorous plant collection and an impressive selection of cycads. The university works alongside the NCB Naturalis (Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis) researching, preserving, and cultivating endangered species, and serious horticultural students flock here to study amongst some of the rarest and most captivating flora to be kept all in one serene oasis tucked away in the historical center, season after season.	A 'living museum' in Leiden, the oldest of its kind in the Netherlands.
