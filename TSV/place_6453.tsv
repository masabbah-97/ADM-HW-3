Thankfully, a thin pane of glass prevents visitors from slipping off the edge, as well as provides them with a breathtaking view while suspended over the mountainside.Due to its abrupt “drop,” the lookout has earned nicknames such as “ski jump” and “diving board.” But offering reassurance, architect Wilhelmsen writes: “It is meant to be scary, but the structure and glass are very safe.” 	A thin pane of glass keeps visitors from sliding off this futuristic skywalk.
