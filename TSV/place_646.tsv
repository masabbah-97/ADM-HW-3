Originally known simply as the “Bowling Ball House” for the (now over 500) painted bowling balls littering the yard in various formations. Pyramids, stacks, and walls of bowling balls adorn the grounds, surrounded by a dizzying landscape of color created by the other works of recycled art all around.Gardens made of colored bottles, rainbow mosaic pathways, and bright ceramic sculptures abound creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. Whimzeyland also features a small gallery where bowling balls decorated and donated by other artists are put on display for visitors to view. 	This home is decked out like a psychedelic explosion of colors and bowling balls.
