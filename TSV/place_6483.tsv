Today the bandshell, as it is commonly referred to, is the oldest structure at the music concourse, with the exception of a few remaining original statues dating to the Midwinter Exposition.The temple is now a popular feature of Golden Gate park, used for picnics and Sunday afternoon band concerts. 	An elaborate gift from Claus Spreckels is now a piece of San Francisco history.
