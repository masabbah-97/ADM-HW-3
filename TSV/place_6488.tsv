News of its existence spread, and the bulb soon appeared on On the Road with Charles Kuralt and in the Guinness Book of World Records and Ripley’s Believe It or Not.The bulb has been moved a few times, once unceremoniously (it was only two years old) in 1903, and then with much more pomp in 1976 when it was transferred with a full police and fire truck escort to its present site. The bulb is now cared for by the Centennial Light Bulb Committee. You can check if the bulb is still going on a live camera feed on the Centennial Bulb’s website.Update as of July 2021: Visitors are no longer allowed inside to see the bulb.	The longest burning light bulb in the world.
