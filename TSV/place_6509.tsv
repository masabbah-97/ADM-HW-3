These original settlers, known as the Ohio Company of Associates, established a cemetery around the Great Mound in 1801, actually saving it from destruction. It’s believed that the cemetery contains more buried Revolutionary War officers than any other cemetery in the country. In 2001, the cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.	At the center of this cemetery stands a 2,000-year-old burial mound of the Adena culture.
