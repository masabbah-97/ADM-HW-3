The first is the strip mall that makes a few key appearances throughout the story. Named through some quirk of reality the Goodwives Shopping Center, its appearance and retail tenants have changed over the years, of course, but it still has a supermarket, although it’s now a Shaw’s instead of the Grand Union shown in the movie.The second location is the ominous-looking Stepford Men’s Association building. In real life, this extravagant castle-like building is actually the 62-room Lockwood-Mathews Mansion in Norwalk. Built in 1868, it sits in the middle of a public park called Mathews Park and is open for tours.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.
