There, you’ll find giant 1,000-year-old red cedars, some exceeding 52 feet (16 meters) in width, with names like Big Tree and Tree Beard. There’s also a beautiful, fully accessible 1,640-foot (500-meter) boardwalk that let visitors meander through one of Canada’s last remaining inland rainforests. 	Thousand-year-old trees tower within one of the world's only inland temperate rainforests.
