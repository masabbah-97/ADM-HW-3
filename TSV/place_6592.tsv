It encompasses three city blocks and includes the contiguous alleyway of Rush Lane. It’s a popular spot to view some of the best examples of Toronto’s vibrant street art and mural culture.Previously a hotspot for unsanctioned graffiti art, Graffiti Alley sparked a fight for legalization by the Queen Street West Business Improvement Association. In 2011, it was designated as an area of municipal significance, and StreetARToronto, or StART, a program that provides funding and approval for public murals and graffiti art, was born from the struggle.Today, Graffiti Alley is a popular backdrop for photoshoots, as well as a place to see works by iconic artists like Duro the Third, uber5000, and ELICSER. It has served as the venue for small street festivals, a set for music videos, and for a time, had a restaurant named after it.	A fantastic place to see murals, and an important location in the history of Toronto's legal street art scene.
