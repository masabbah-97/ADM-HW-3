From magnificent stained glass window panes to ornate salvaged woodwork such as doors, entryways, and mantles to glorious chandeliers that would make Marie Antoinette do a double take.Dig through dusty crates of antique fixtures and doo-dads galore or take a siesta in the darling outdoor courtyard where pretty wrought-iron cafe furniture and fanciful outdoor showpieces await. If you’re lucky, you may even stumble upon open art studios in the upper levels of the building, which are some of the most beautiful, stripped down warehouse studios in Northeast.	A warehouse for all of your architectural details.
