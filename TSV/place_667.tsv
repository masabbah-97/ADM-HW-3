Although the area was recognized as a national park in 1954, Native Americans had been dwelling in the area and underneath the natural bridge for hundreds of years.Just a short walk from the bridge is a mysterious carving of an Indian head, similar to that on the buffalo nickel. Despite some guesses that the carving depicts a chief from the area, almost nothing is known about who created the relief, when, or for what purpose.Visitors strolling through the park can take in the incredible landscape for just $3.50. Unfortunately, you are no longer allowed to walk over the bridge for safety purposes, as there are no guard rails, and the 200-million-year old bridge cannot be trusted to hold thousands of visitors each month.	148 feet long and in the middle of a verdant forest.
