As part of its initial display at the festival, a woman strapped bacon to her feet and hopped inside the pan carrying a giant spatula. After the clam celebration, the oversized oddity travelled around the West Coast, but Long Beach had a replica built to forever remember their part in its creation. The surface of the pan is over nine feet across and the tip of the handle is almost 15 feet off the ground. Strangely there are a handful of other “World’s Largest Frying Pans” across America alone, putting Long Beach’s culinary landmark in one of the strangest competitions for legitimacy ever cooked up. 	This super-sized skillet is a replica of a usable giant pan where a woman once skated on bacon.
