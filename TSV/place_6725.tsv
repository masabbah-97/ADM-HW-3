Carved out by a running stream that turns into a luminescent waterfall as it flows through the roof of the cave, La Cueva de Esplendor is a popular hiking destination. The cave is accessible by horse or foot and some tours even offer minor spelunking into the cave’s darker depths.	Enchanting cave with a river crashing through the roof.
