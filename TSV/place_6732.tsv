The spot is right down the street from where the Nirvana frontman grew up, and it’s directly next to the Young Street Bridge.Immortalized in the Nirvana song “Something in the Way,” the Young Street Bridge was one of Cobain’s favorite locations to hang out. Fittingly, the song’s lyrics are displayed on a plaque in the park. The park also features a memorial plaque and graffiti tributes under the bridge. Additionally, visitors will spot a granite headstone with Cobain quotes, the “Kurt’s Air Guitar” stand sculpture, a couple of portraits of the artist, and a large guitar statue in his honor. 	A tribute to the Nirvana frontman hides beneath the bridge that was the singer's beloved hangout spot.
