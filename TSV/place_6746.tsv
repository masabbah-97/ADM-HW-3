It is a fascinating look at how criminals were identified before the ages of fingerprinting and DNA checks. Also keep an eye out for the wax head of murder Henri Pranzini, made from his guillotined head, and an eclectic collection of confiscated brass knuckles. 	A museum which takes visitors to the côté obscure of Paris.
