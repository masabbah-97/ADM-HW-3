Welling Court, which can feel like a run-of-the-mill quiet neighborhood, received an artistic makeover when the residents reached out to Ad Hoc Art NYC Bushwick gallery with a project in mind. Inviting Ad Hoc Art NYC to transform their streets into a canvas, the Welling Court Murals Project officially kicked off in May 2010 with colorful street art adorning the walls of this community. The residential streets of Welling Court run outwards from a center-point—likes spokes on a wheel—stretching out in a parade of color and street art in all directions.Claiming to be one of the best examples of contemporary street art on earth, the Welling Court Murals Project now displays murals from 150 artists from both New York City and countries around the world. For street art aficionados, some of the past artists to be featured at the Welling Court Murals include Lady Pink, Tristan Easton, Cey Adams, Wane COD, Greg Lamarche, Queen Andrea, and a slew of others.	A collaborative art project that transformed a neighborhood in NYC's Queens.	Socrates Sculpture Park,Our Lady of Mt.
