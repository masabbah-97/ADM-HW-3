The Ramble is home to waterfalls, ponds, bridges, meadows, sheer rock cliffs, and views of the rolling hills. Its centerpiece is the garden itself, complete with small stone shrines surrounded by water features. Hiking trails welcome visitors of all abilities, from meandering paths through wildflower meadows—to rocky climbs that reward visitors with views from the top of Mount Zion. The view also encompasses the battlefield. Davidson allowed curious locals to enjoy the land for decades, and after his death in 2016, the property was turned over to the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation for the enjoyment of the public. 	This magnificent Japanese garden provides a moment of Zen in rural Vermont.
