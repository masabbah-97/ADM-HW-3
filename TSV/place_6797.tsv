This isn’t the first balancing rock to be discovered, and scientists believe that glaciers - capable of carrying such a heavy rock with them - left it behind as they receded to the North over 8,000 years ago. The power of glaciers trumps even giants.	Legend has this precariously placed rock was placed by giants. Science has another explanation.
