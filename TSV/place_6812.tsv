Named after the lumber mill baron who developed the area, William Henry Britton, the record setting peak is marked by a stone marker in the middle of a dilapidated rotunda. As the nation’s lowest highpoint, Britton Hill offers a wide, view of the surrounding landscape, but the view is often obstructed by tree lines that dwarf the hill. In fact the Florida state high point is so low, it is lower than the LOWEST points in at least 16 other states. Britton Hill will never win any awards for verticality but peak baggers and high pointers across the country continue to honor the humble elevation.  	The highest point in Florida is still the lowest high point in the country.
