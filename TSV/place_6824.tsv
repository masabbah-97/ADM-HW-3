0	36 Rue Saint Sulpice	places to stay,shops	109	427	When walking along the Rue Saint Sulpice, you probably won’t notice that the the number plate on building 36 is larger and more colorful than the standard blue-and-white version.What happened in this building to afford it a marking that stands out among the others?If you were a Belle Epoque Parisian man, you would automatically recognize this oversized faience plate as a signal for a maison close, a house of pleasure.This building was Miss Betty’s brothel, specializing in “dominatrix role play.” The brothel was a very popular address among the extensive ecclesiastic crowd of the Saint Sulpice area. Priests were said to be particularly drawn to the “crucifixion parlor” and the “Satan’s Hell” torture room.	An unusual number plate signifies the building's saucy past.
