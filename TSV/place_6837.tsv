0	Troll Haven	trolls	86	425	The property is home to a collection of statues that include hundreds of trolls, as well as elves, witches, wizards, giants, dragons and other mythological creatures. They dot the grounds of rental properties across Troll Haven. One such property, the Gatekeeper’s Castle, is fitted with its own dungeon. Apples, Pears, Figs, Cherries, and other fruit orchards are grown on the property and can be sampled by visitors. The trolls are all located on private property so patrons must admire the creations from the road. Although many of the homes at Troll Haven are rental properties, other buildings/areas serve as event sites for weddings, parties, reunions, or business retreats.	A magical sanctuary of mythological statuary.
