The City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department doesn’t acknowledge it as a site of interest. It’s just there. In the middle of everything and few people, aside from some seasoned kayakers and fishers, seem to know it.The island is covered in trees and at various times has featured a tree swing, trapeze, rope swing, fire pit, and picnic tables (apparently brought by an agile and ingenious kayaker). There’s also a well-kept grave for a dog named Squiggles. And once in a while the occasional (illegal) camper.But are there snakes? You’ll just have to find out for yourself.
