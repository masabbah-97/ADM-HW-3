Rondinone used locally sourced boulders, and chose this location because it’s “physically and symbolically mid-way between the natural and the artificial.”Visitors can walk right up to the stacked boulders, as well as read interpretive signage and use cell phones to listen to an audio tour.Update as of July 2019: Though the Seven Magic Mountains were intended to be taken down in 2018, the Bureau of Land Management issued a three-year permit for the display to remain through the end of 2021.
