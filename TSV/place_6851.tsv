The warm springs, after which the town is named, did provide some improvement to his condition. However ultimately, Little White House was also the site of Roosevelt’s death. On April 12, 1945, the former president suffered a stroke while sitting for a portrait.	FDR hoped to find a cure for polio in this Georgia town's warm springs.
