0	Woodland Chapel at Woodsgate	places to stay,sacred spaces	62	424	As if not British-sounding enough, this wedding clearing is on the property of an inn called Stroudsmoor. Where are the velvet pantaloons and whinnying horses? Jokes aside, this elegant locale contains an energy as if somewhere in its oak, maple, and evergreen midst, a nick in the fabric of this dimension exists, leaking other-worldliness to the effect of leaves fluttering just a bit too perfectly, stream babbling a bit too coherently. Nearby is the 30,000-acre Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which possesses its own level of majesty.	An ideal wedding spot that is almost too ideal.
