The Blue Horizon was constructed in 1865 originally as three four-story houses. Boxing matches became a regular occurrence at the Blue Horizon in 1961, playing host to several iconic matches. Even legendary punk rock band The Dead Kennedys performed there in November of 1985. However, the venue ceased operations in 2010. The building and ring are also well-known for their appearance in Rocky V. However, the Blue Horizon’s best days are behind it, the arena is now slated to become a Moxy brand Marriott Hotel.	A legendary boxing venue and ring featured in Rocky V.
