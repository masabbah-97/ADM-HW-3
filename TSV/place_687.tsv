One robot stands 50 feet tall, and others have microwaves or other bits of found materials embedded in their chests in this ever-growing alien landscape of outside art. Update as of December 2019: The Robo Lights will not be running this year, but may return in 2020Update as of November 2020: Robolights is open but by appointment only.	An outdoor sculpture park of giant pink robots and post-apocalyptic Christmas scenes.	'The Babies',Ruddy's General Store Museum,Lee R.
