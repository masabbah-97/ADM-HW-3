The interior of the the crown is a small viewing area accessed by an equally small elevator inside the column, providing stunning views of the city and Port Vell. The statue is not pointing towards the new world but possibly in the direction of Columbus home city of Genoa.Inside the base of the monument, in addition to the elevator is a gift shop where you can purchase tickets to visit the observation deck for 6 euro and also a wine bar and shop.	A vista of the city and sea from atop the little-known viewing deck on an unassuming Columbus statue.
