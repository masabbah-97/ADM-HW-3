Griffis Jr. started the park in 1966 and founded the Ashford Hollow Foundation for the Visual and Performing Arts. The Foundation, now headed by Griffis’s son, maintains the sculpture park. The park is filled with Griffis’s original sculptures, as well as the work of Leon Gerst, Duayne Hatchett, Tony Patterson, and Glenn Zweygert.The park is not only a a venue for unique sculptures, but it also serves as a nature preserve, making it a one of a kind chance to view the beauty created by both man and nature. Many sculptures accent the trails, surprising pedestrians in a meadow and along a pond. The park questions the boundaries between viewer and art, visitors are even encouraged to touch and play on the sculptures.	A collection of unique outdoor sculptures surounded by the beauty of nature.	American Museum of Cutlery,J.N.
