0	Coleman Theatre	theaters,film	131	419	Located on historic Route 66, the gorgeous Coleman Theatre was built in 1929. Originally serving as a vaudeville theatre and movie palace, the theatre’s original “Mighty Wurlitzer” pipe organ was sold due to economic difficulties in the 1970s but was returned to its original home in 1996. Today, it can still be heard providing the musical accompaniment to classic silent films, just as it did in 1929.Built by George L. Coleman Sr., the theatre was designed by the architectural firm Boller Brothers of Kansas City, Missouri and features a beautiful Spanish Colonial Revival exterior and a Louis XV interior. 	This historic theater's pipe organ still accompanies silent films just like it did in 1929.
