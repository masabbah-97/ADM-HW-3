The outdoor pools are just one way. There’s also saunas, baths and steam rooms for a selection of ways to relax with what is probably humans’ favorite molecule.The area has been used since the 16th century. At the Aqua Dome, officially approved as a mineral spa under Tyrolean spa law, warm spring water rises from below.To add to the watery selection of attractions, there’s also a variety of interesting architectural features, most notably the three UFO-esque pools. These pools were constructed to give the swimmer a further sense of weightlessness in addition to their natural buoyancy. A 100°C sauna, shower world, ice-cold grotto and trail of alternating cold, warm, then cold water are also highlights.In addition to the unique spa, there is an attached hotel.Adapted with permission from uniqhotels.com	Visitors dip into a variety of pools of what was once ice.
