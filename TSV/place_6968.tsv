Lark Hill Place is a mock-up Victorian street, complete with genuine street signs and fittings that allow museum visitors the chance to feel as through they’ve been transported back to 1897.The cobbled street replicates the ambiance of a winter’s evening, just after the gas lamps had been lit, when people would have been hurrying back from work and perhaps popping into a shop on their way home. The sounds of horse-drawn carriages and children playing traditional games add to the sense of immersion.A range of Victorian businesses line the street, including a chemist, blacksmith, toy shop, and printers, all fitted out with genuine Victorian artifacts salvaged from Salford and Manchester. There’s even a pub, The Blue Lion Tavern, though don’t expect to buy a drink there. Instead, visitors can read information boards detailing what daily life was like for those living in the area when Queen Victoria was on the throne.	This dreamy street will transport you to wintertime in Victorian England.
