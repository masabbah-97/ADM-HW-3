Architect, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue designed the building in collaboration with architectural sculptor Lee Lawrie (famous for the Atlas at Rockefeller Center in NYC) and muralist Hildreth Meiere. Meiere’s career got a mega jumpstart as a result of the project. The NAS also maintains rotating art exhibits, as well as a permanent collection that explores the various themes of science and culture. 	For 60 years, the academy had no permanent location until members voted Washington D.C. as its forever home.
