Lovecraft and his supposedly fictional book of the dead, the Necronomicon. According to a story that has been generally accepted among the more superstitious Bradford alumni, Lovecraft briefly dated a student from the college and during their relationship he hid the REAL Necronomicon in a sealed tunnel beneath the school’s Tupelo Pond.   Lovecraft went on to base his fictional Miskatonic University, which became a fixture of the shared world of many of his stories, on Bradford’s historical campus so it is hard to say whether the story existed prior to his focus on the school. The closed Bradford College has since been purchased and is now the Northpoint Bible College, so discovering the truth behind a hidden book of unspeakable evil is less likely than ever.	A defunct all-girls college which may be the resting place of H.P. Lovecraft's real-life Necronomicon.
