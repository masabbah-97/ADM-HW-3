The rock earned its name from the thought that trailblazers traveling West had to reach the rock before July 4th to avoid getting caught in potentially devastating winter weather.  Travelers on their way to California and Oregon would often pass the boulder and inscribe their name into the wind-polished stone. This practice became so widespread that the rock was at one time dubbed, “The Register of the Desert.” While many of the names have smoothed and flaked off, a number of the original inscriptions remain to this day.   	A popular rock that acted as a waymarker for American pioneers.
