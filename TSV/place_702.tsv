It includes such gems as Blackbeard’s blunderbuss and pieces of gold retrieved from his warship the Queen Anne’s Revenge; one of only two remaining authentic Jolly Roger flags; and Thomas Tew’s original treasure chest, the only known authentic pirate treasure chest in the world. The exhibits wind you through a history of this nefarious profession, displaying numerous pirate weapons, heaps of treasure, information on each buccaneer’s life, and writing and art depicting these feared fortune-hunters.The museum was originally located in Key West and known as the “Pirate Soul Museum.” It was relocated in 2012 to St. Augustine, a historic pirate port.
