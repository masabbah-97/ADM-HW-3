The exhibition halls that house the gift shop and gallery of the park are modeled after traditional Korean architecture, but very little else is of a “traditional” nature in this park.Bulkkeuni (a phallus wearing yellow mittens) and Saekkeuni (a vagina modeling a floppy hat and bow), the park’s mascots, welcome visitors through the front gates. The restrooms adhere to the sexual theme as well: two breasts for handles on the men’s door, and an erect penis as a doorknob for the women’s door.The outdoor theme park features 140 sculptures representing humans in various sexual positions.After the Korean War, the island became a popular honeymoon destination for Korean couples, due to the island’s warm climate. Many of the couples had wed because of arranged marriages, and the island also became known for being a center of sex education.Visitors are required to be at least 18 years old, and a separate play area is available for minors while adults visit.Update as of September 2022: The location is closed indefinitely. 	South Korea's only sex-themed park.
