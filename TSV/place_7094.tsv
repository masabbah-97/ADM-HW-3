Close to this, a surprising figure lurks in the dark, waiting to greet curious visitors.A giant clay/mud golem stands within the room, seemingly holding the weight of Paris in its mighty hands. It is not known how old it is, and who exactly built it. But it is made by artistic cataphiles who wish to express themselves creatively. This golem is the only known large statue in the whole network, though there are some smaller carvings that can be found on walls. 	A mud statue stands in the dark tunnels, seeming to hold up the weight of the city above.
