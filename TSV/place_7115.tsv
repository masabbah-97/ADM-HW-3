It stands outside the casino’s patisserie, and the Guinness Book of World Records certified it as the world’s largest chocolate fountain. Who’s their competition? As of 2019, a chocolate fountain in a Zurich Lindt store, which stands 30 feet tall. While this Swiss fountain has now been crowned the world’s largest, the Bellagio fountain remains in marvelous motion all day, every day.	Formerly the world's largest, this Willy Wonka-esque contraption runs 24/7.
