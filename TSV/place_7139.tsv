The simply-named Frying Pan Lake occupies 38,000 square meters in part of the volcanic crater. The shallow waters average a deadly 110-130 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the lake is only about 18 feet deep, but at vents parts of it plunge down to 60 feet.Some sources claim that Frying Pan Lake is the largest hot spring in the world, while others favor Boiling Lake in Dominica, Lesser Antilles; Glenwood Springs in Colorado; or the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park.	Deadly scalding and one of the largest hot springs in the world.
