Over the years, visitors have speculated on whether these water features are human-made or natural, but the answer is somewhere in between.The falls were diverted and expanded more than 200 years ago to be used as a power source by Victorian textile workers. The large waterfall was inspired by a natural one, though its height was doubled to form a better reservoir.Visitors to the park can explore the waterfalls and their surroundings on the trails that crisscross through the woodland, including boardwalks over marshy ground. The remnants of the textile works which the waterfalls once powered can still be observed, including exposed wooden boards and iron beams, but these suburban waterfalls are as beautiful to look at as any in Scotland, despite their industrial history.	These semi-natural waterfalls hint at the park's Victorian-era industrial past.
