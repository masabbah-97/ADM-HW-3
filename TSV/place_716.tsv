While not as large as some of the other desert attractions in the state, the smooth, undulating ridges and loops at Fantasy Canyon seem like they were transported straight from a science-fiction film.The formations are the product of ancient rivers and lakes that used to cover the area, depositing layers of sand and mud that hardened into rock before being sculpted into mystical shapes by the elements. Visitors can take the short hike into the canyon and have a sit on the single round bench. It’s almost like taking a siesta on the surface of Mars.   	Sandstone rock formations that look like they belong on the cover of a progressive rock album.
