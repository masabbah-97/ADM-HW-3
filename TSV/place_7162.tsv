After centuries of wear and erosion, it’s amazing how clear and vibrant the drawings have remained. The entire V Bar V Heritage Site contains around 13 panels containing more than 1,000 petroglyphs. The various panels are also some of the easiest to locate.It’s believed that these marvelous carvings were created by the Southern Sinagua culture between 900 and 1350. The petroglyphs were created in the “Beaver Creek Rock Art Style,” which has been seen in other carvings across the heritage site and other rock art sites along Beaver Creek.	The largest and most well-preserved petroglyph site in the Verde Valley.
