Featuring all major religions and a fantastic stained glass ceiling, the magnificent interior leads into one of the heads, where there is a temple and ancient Buddha statues on display. Below ground is a museum of Thai pottery built by Lek Viriyaphant, the same man behind the Sanctuary of Truth and Ancient Siam Park, who sought to preserve Thai cultures and arts for future generations.	This museum has a most unusual location: inside a giant, three-headed elephant.
