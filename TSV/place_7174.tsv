The room was built in 1989 and has under 30 square feet of space on the inside. Just large enough for a bride, a groom and someone to wed them, so long as they don’t mind getting crammed together. The titular Cross Island is nowhere to be seen, but there is a small cross jutting out from some exposed rocks in the pond, which is the most likely candidate.  	Possibly the smallest church in the world floats in the middle of a pond.
