In the heart of this region and pretty much exemplifying the aesthetic is a lovely wooded waterfall called the Schiessentümpel.Part of the Black Ernz river, the Schiessentümpel cascades over a large boulder, and in doing so splits the flow a trio of clear streams, before they collect once again at the bottom of the falls. The water is split due to three long grooves that have been eroded into the boulder over the ages, making it look almost like a giant hand is allowing the water to sieve through its fingers. Of course this happens at the bottom of a small ravine which has also been carved out of the rock by the ages of water flowing over its surface, leaving two sheer walls on either side of the waterfall. To make the scene even more of a J.R.R. Tolkien dream, a crudely designed rock and wood bridge has been installed over the ravine to bridge the gap. The crooked wood rails of the arch make it look like it was made by some elvish woodspeople. The waterfall and its fantastical bridge are a favorite location for locals and tourists who want to make their lives a little more unbelievable.The Schiessentümpel might be a symbol of Little Switzerland, but it could just as easily have been a favorite spot in a Little Middle-Earth, which we can only hope more cities will begin to try and identify.     	This tri-part waterfall is a little bit of fairytale beauty in the heart of Luxembourg's Little Switzerland.
