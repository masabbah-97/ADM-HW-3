After Church’s death the Olana estate was passed down to Church’s son and from there on down family lines. Keeping the mansion and land among those close to the artist’s family has ensured that the interior decor and stunning vistas have remained in their original condition, maintaining the feel of a living painting in the Hudson River School style.  Today, the mansion and its 250 acres of land act as a museum to the artist and his placid style, and the site has been designated a New York State historic site. Visitors, ignoring trucks crossing the Rip Van Winkle Bridge or cars revving down 9G, can try to experience the Hudson Valley as it appeared to Church. Olana is still furnished much as it was before his death in 1900 and contains a number of his works. Fans of both art and nature will be at home in this living museum. 	The Hudson River School comes alive at this palatial estate.
