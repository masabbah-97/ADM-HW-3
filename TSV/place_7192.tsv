0	'The Sale of Manhattan'	kcymaerxthaere,stairs,plaques	31	405	Created by Eames Demetrios, Kcymaerxthaere is a “parallel universe that intersects with much of our linear Earth, but with different stories, creatures, peoples, even laws of physics and qualities of existence.”  The project has been likened to a novel with every page in a different place. What makes the Kcymaerxthaere project particularly interesting is that Demetrios installs informative markers and historical sites at the locations in our world that connect to his world, creating real-world intersections with his imagined universe.  Most of these installations are bronze or stone plaques inscribed with stories but some are larger, even entire buildings. As of 2021, there are more than 140 sites spread across six continents and 30 countries.These images represent the Sale of Manhattan Marker when it was installed. Sadly, visitors to the location report it is gone, though it was respected by graffiti artists for the longest time (see one of the gallery images). This is, of course, very distressing, but we are working hard to make the information remains accessible on site. We look forward to replacing it in a more secure manner. Why is it still on this list? Because it was installed here for many years, and we don’t let vandals determine where the events of Kcymaerxthaere happened.The story concerns the Sale of Manhattan to the Future Gwome Manhattaan to settle the equivalent of a 24 dollar gambling debt. There was much work that had been done to the land here, indeed, it was one of the most famous of the Monastery Districts, but slowly a more beautiful one arose, hovering above the waters offshore, and myriad creatures made this district their home.	Down a stairway in the East Village, you could once read a plaque describing an alternate history of a fictional version of Manhattan.
