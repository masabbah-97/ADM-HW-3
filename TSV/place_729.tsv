0	Empire Garden Restaurant	Unique Restaurants & Bars	654	1596	Although the name of this restaurant is ambiguous (it reads Empire on one sign and Emperor on the other), there is one thing that is certain about this hidden treasure of a Chinese restaurant: grandeur and extravagance. Built under the ornate, high ceilings of an abandoned, old-fashioned movie theater, visitors can enjoy an extensive menu of Chinese and Dim Sum delicacies, including treats such as chicken foot.Located in Bostonâ€™s Chinatown on Washington Street, Empire Garden Dim Sum is served from 8:30am to 3pm daily. There is usually a wait between the hours of 11am to 2pm, therefore it is suggested to get there at exactly 2, where you will be seated immediately, with carts of food ready to fill your table in less than 30 seconds.	Dim sum, served in a grand old theater.
