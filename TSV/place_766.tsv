While it did not earn this distinction, the site is a uniquely beautiful location and is protected as a state park. The falls make for a fantastical photo opportunity, just be sure you don’t lose yourself in the park’s beauty or hikers won’t be likely to find you either.	An obscure waterfall that looks like something out of a fantasy novel.
