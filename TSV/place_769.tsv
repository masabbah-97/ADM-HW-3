Rosehill is home to beautiful monuments and several ghost stories, although none is more terrifying than the real life clown that was spotted in the cemetery at night by a passerby and caught on video.Rosehill is a quintessential Victorian cemetery with underlying themes of Victorian iconography: the draped urns, the obelisks, the arches. Unlike its neighboring cemetery, Graceland, Rosehill’s monuments are a bit more subdued. Several Chicago mayors and other notables including Richard Sears, the founder of Sears Roebuck & Co., Aaron Montgomery Ward, the founder of Montgomery Ward & Co., and John G. Shedd, the founder of the Shedd aquarium are entombed here. Rosehill is also home to a large Civil War memorial and Firefighter’s memorial. 	Chicago's largest cemetery is full of beautiful Victorian monuments and more than a few ghost stories.
