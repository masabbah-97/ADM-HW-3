0	Blue Moon Tavern	bars,Unique Restaurants & Bars	714	1545	Built in 1934 after the repeal of prohibition, the Blue Moon became popular because of its proximity to the nearby University of Washington Campus.But that’s not why it’s stayed so popular.Local laws prohibited the sale of alcohol within a mile of the school for years, making it an appealing respite for thirsty university students. From there its legend grew as an oasis for carousers and goodhearted rule breakers.Eventually, the Blue Moon realized its true potential as a haven for counter-culture. Over the years it has been visited by the likes of Theodore Rothke, Tom Robbins, Jack Kerouac (allegedly), Allen Ginsburg, and Dylan Thomas.	This popular bar has been blurring the line between normal and edgy for more than 75 years.
