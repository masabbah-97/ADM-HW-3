Nine carefully selected restaurants occupy the recreated storefronts, representing many of Japan’s regional takes on ramen. Since few people in their right minds could choose between Sapporo-style noodles and chaa-shu (traditional roast pork) or Hokkaido’s version garnished with kikurage (“wood ear”), most restaurants offer half servings for maximum ramen overload.Folks interested in the sweet over the savory can visit a period-accurate candy shop or partake in cotton candy hawked by street vendors without missing any of the old-timey fun.	This historical theme park celebrates all things noodle.
