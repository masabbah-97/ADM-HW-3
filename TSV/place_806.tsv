Viewed from the top or the bottom, it’s spectacular.The drop down onto Wildcat Beach is about 40 feet. The unusual sight of the water as it falls over the shale cliffs and into the Pacific Ocean is worth making the trek out to this wilderness cascade.Getting to Alamere Falls is straightforward, but not effortless. The hike to the falls is a minimum 13 miles (20 km) round-trip hike.  To reach the most popular trailhead, you’ll drive through Bolinas, which can be a challenge—at least without a GPS—since the town tends to resist any attempts to betray its location to “outsiders.” (Every time CalTrans puts up signs on Highway 1, locals remove them.) From there, it’s a significant hike into the Phillip Burton Wilderness, part of the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County.Despite the effort required to reach it, the unique site is a popular spot with visitors. Alamere Falls is one of just two tidefalls on the California coast; the other is McWay Falls in Big Sur. 	"This rare example of a ""tidefall"" is a spectacular drop from the cliffs down onto the beach."	1906 Earthquake Fence,Dad O'Rourke's Bench,Point Reyes Boat	Alamere Falls Trail,Bolinas, California, 94924,United States	37.9537	-122.7834	RCH	 	2018-03-07	17 Wonders of America's National Parks,The 10 Best Places of 2018	River Canyons of Jordan,Cascade Falls,Mzinyathi Falls,Hengifoss	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alamere-falls
