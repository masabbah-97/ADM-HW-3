A closer look could very well uncover cocoons, or you may even catch a hatching. The butterfly house offers two levels from which to seek sights of the colorful flyers.A short film at the end of your walk though the butterfly habitat will give you some scientific insight on the ethereal creatures you just enjoyed inside the tropical forest in the center of a city.	A tropical paradise just a short trip from the opera house is filled with beautiful winged creatures.
