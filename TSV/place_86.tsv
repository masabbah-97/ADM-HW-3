Having sold items to nearly every famous magician for the last 90 years, the guys in Tannen’s know the tricks of the trade—literally: If you have any reservations or are simply curious about a product, they’ll happily demonstrate its uses for you.If perusing the store makes you want to be one of those famous magicians, they also offer magic camp and classes. The store’s new location at Herald Square is also right down the hallway from the Flosso-Hornman-Martinka store, where its president, Harry Houdini, used to reside.	New York's oldest magic store.
