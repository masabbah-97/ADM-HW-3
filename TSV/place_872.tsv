The Museum of the Bizarre, which opened in 2015, houses a medley of the macabre.For just $3, guests can take their time viewing the private collection of Justin LaNasa, a local tattoo artist. LaNasa was inspired to open the museum as his wedding day approached and he realized he needed a place to store his accumulation of abnormalities.A life-sized Pinhead greets visitors upon entering, and there’s another life-size Freddy that people can take pictures with. Other items on display include a lock of Alexander Hamilton’s hair, letters from serial killers, a crystal skull, a two-headed calf, Harry Houdini’s ouija board, and vintage medical equipment. There are also slightly less credible objects exhibited, like an imprint of Bigfoot’s footprint, a unicorn horn, a chupacabra hand, and the remains of a mermaid.The museum holds a haunted house each year to celebrate Halloween, and occasionally hosts movie nights. 	A curious collection of oddities including a lock of Alexander Hamilton's hair and Harry Houdini's ouija board.
