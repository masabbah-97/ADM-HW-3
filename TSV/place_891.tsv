The only alterations made were considered necessary for safety and construction allowing Senosiain to stay true to his organic architecture ethic.The twisting walkways of Quetzalcoatl’s Nest provide some pretty spectacular views of the ravines and canyons so long as you don’t mind standing in the jaws of an Aztec snake god.Update: As of July 2019, this location can be accessed through overnight rental stays. There are events planned for the public throughout 2019, as the park plans to become fully accessible to the public in the coming years. 	An Aztec snake god has taken the material form of an apartment complex.
