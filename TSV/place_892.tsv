Along this trail are many stark white Fraser fir snags, ghosts of once-regal firs that were poisoned from the inside by an invasive insect species, the balsam woolly adelgid.First introduced from Europe around 1900, these insects feed on fir trees and their saliva impedes new growth via a toxin. The adelgid is thought to have killed 95% of all Fraser firs in the park, and fir trees here have a 90-99% chance of hosting the insect. The observation tower that hovers 50 feet over the highest point in Tennessee  presents a view partially made up of the natural destruction. However despite the infestation, Clingmans Dome’s views of the Smokies are still spectacular on a clear day. 	The highest point in Tennessee, Clingmans Dome bears witness to the ravages of one type of insect.
