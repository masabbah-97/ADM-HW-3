It connects the Atlanta neighborhoods of Cabbagetown and Inman Park, attracting residents from both sides who are looking for a place to make their mark with street art. The graffiti tradition in the tunnel dates back to the 1960s, and continues to this day.From small tags to huge murals to underground festival flyers, the concrete walls and pillars are a chaotic kaleidoscope of overlapping and ever-shifting images, words, and ideas. The messages are a mix of political commentary, philosophical musings, and everything in between. People have even spray-painted marriage proposals on the walls.The art changes on a regular basis, as artists cover up old work and build on top of existing art. Locals are protective of the tunnel, which serves as both art canvas and community message board.	An underground magnet for ever-changing street art.
