0	National Museum of Funeral History	funeral cars,funeral art,collections,museums	516	1410	Nestled in a quiet neighborhood of Houston, Texas, the National Museum of Funeral History hosts an unlikely collection celebrating our final send-off.From a visual history of embalming to African fantasy coffins, the museum is a fascinating look at the history, science, and art of death. Featured in its unique collection is JFK’s original eternal flame, a diverse array of funeral programs from famous people, and a collection of beautiful hearses, both horse-drawn and motorized, including a tragic funeral bus which more than lived up to its name.The specially designed funeral bus was meant to carry both coffin and mourners, but—when climbing a steep hill in San Francisco—it tipped over, sending both the living and the dead flying onto the street. It was quickly retired from service.An exhibit about presidential funerals includes a bill from George Washington’s funeral and the hearse used to carry the bodies of both Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. Visitors can pay their respects to Abraham Lincoln via a full-scale replica of Lincoln lying in repose. In addition to the faux body, the museum has a genuine lock of the 16th president’s hair.The museum is also home to a school that teaches embalming.	Fantastic collection celebrating the final send-off.	‘Moonwalker’,DeLorean Museum,Art Car Museum	415 Barren Springs Drive ,Houston, Texas, 77090,United States	29.9895	-95.4306		retrofuturistic,Archie13,CryptKat,Andie,wythe,coffinzm,sidb	2010-07-14	The Ultimate Guide to Scattered Body Parts	Bestattungsmuseum (Vienna Undertakers' Museum),Museo De Arte Virreinal (Museum of Viceroyalty Art),Museum of Sepulchral Culture,Hudson Museum	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-funeral-history
