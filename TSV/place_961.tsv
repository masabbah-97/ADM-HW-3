At the top of the falls, a view extends into New York State’s Taconic State Park. In trying to attain this view, however, 25 people have died from slips while rock climbing or jumping into a seemingly deep but really shallow pool. Steel cables have been added to various walkways to lessen the dangers, but AOL Travel has named these falls one of the most dangerous travel destinations in the U.S.The falls also have a pair of macabre legends associated with its summit. Bash-Bish, a Mohican woman living in a  village nearby, was accused of adultery by a jealous friend, and was then lashed to a canoe to be sent over the falls despite her pleas of innocence. A ring of butterflies was seen above her head before she went over, and in the aftermath her body was not found. Tragedy would repeat itself when her daughter, White Swan, failed to conceive a child with the village chief’s son before he married a new wife. She threw herself off the falls to her death in her despair.Grim legends and death aside, the falls are a beautiful nature spot. Just try not to kill yourself. 	One of the most scenic falls in Massachusetts has a history of death and grim legend.
