Trilobites, hard-shelled, invertebrate marine creatures, roamed the ocean floor 500 million years ago. Trilobite fossils of over 8 species can be found relatively easily due to their near-perfect preservation in the easily split limestone shale.At U-DIG Fossils in Delta, Utah, owners of this prehistoric cemetery provide fossil hunters the opportunity to find the perfect specimen. The U-DIG staff exposes fresh rock with an excavator on a regular basis. Tools are provided and the average visitor finds ten to twenty trilobites in a four-hour period.	Dig for your own trilobites in this goldmine of invertebrates.
