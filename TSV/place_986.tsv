Yet here one sits, looking beautifully out of place, like something out of a fairytale: moat, drawbridge, dungeon, and all. Newman’s Castle is the private residence of Mike Newman, who owns a bakery in the small town of Bellville. Newman’s Bakery has long been a local fixture, but Newman “wanted to do more than make donuts,” as he told a local news station. And so he did what any self-respecting eccentric Texan would do and built himself a giant castle.After several years of construction—during which plenty of people thought he’d gone nuts—Newman finished his magnificent new abode in 2006, and opened it up for guests to visit. Now he wears a crown on guided tours to “let them know who’s king.”The impressive home has a working drawbridge and trebuchet, a gator-filled moat, a great hall, towers, courtyard, and training grounds. Visitors are taken throughout the entire castle, and encouraged to touch and play with all the curiosities they find. 	A medieval castle in the middle of rural Texas.
