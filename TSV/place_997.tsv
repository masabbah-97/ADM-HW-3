It is most interesting for its waterworks. 92,000 gallons flow through the 300-year-old hydro-pneumatic devices that are connected to reservoirs and channels. The water starts at the stunning 350-meter-long Grand Cascade that descends from an octagon-shaped building surmounted by a pyramid topped with a giant statue of Hercules.From there, the water bounds through waterfalls and water rapids all the way to the Grand Fountain that is more of a geyser shooting up 50 meters. There are also follies like faux ruins, a Chinese pagoda, and a Roman aqueduct decorating the park. The park was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. 	A sprawling Baroque park with 300-year-old hydro-pneumatic waterworks.
